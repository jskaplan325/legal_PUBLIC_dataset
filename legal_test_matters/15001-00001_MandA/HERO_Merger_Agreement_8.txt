(d)No Effect on Dissenter Rights.The Parties agree that any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock as a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in any determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares pursuant to Chapter 13 of the California Code as contemplated by Section 3.01(d) and that none of the Parties shall take any position to the contrary in any appraisal proceeding.

(b)Payment Procedures. (i)As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall be in form and contain provisions which Parent may specify and which are reasonably acceptable to the 12 Company) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.Each holder of record of one or more Certificates shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate or Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(c), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock, which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the transfer or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.02(b)(i), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any payment to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article III. (ii)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Common Stock Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III.In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Common Stock Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time (or, at any later time at which such Common Stock Book-Entry Shares shall be so converted) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time the amount of cash to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(c) (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time), and the Common Stock Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be canceled. (c)No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or automatically, in the case of Common Stock Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or such Common Stock Book-Entry Shares. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of and exchanged as provided in this Article III. (d)Termination of the Exchange Fund.Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have 13 not theretofore complied with this Article III and the instructions set forth in the letter of transmittal shall, subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law, thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article III. (e)No Liability.None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent nor any of their respective Representatives shall be liable to any person in respect of any distributions from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to four (4) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any international, national, regional, state, local or other government, any court, administrative, regulatory or other governmental agency, commission, arbitral body or authority or any organized securities exchange (each, a “Governmental Entity”)), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. (f)Investment of Exchange Fund.The Paying Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent.Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of Parent. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. (g)Lost Certificates.If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III. (h)Withholding Rights.Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (including the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration) such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent determine are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Law relating to Taxes.To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Certificates in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 14 ARTICLE IV REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SECTION 4.01.Representations and Warranties of the Company.Except (i) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents publicly available since January 29, 2011, but prior to the date of this Agreement, other than any forward-looking disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, any disclosures in any section relating to forward-looking statements and any other disclosures included therein to the extent they are non-specific, predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature; and (ii) as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the “Company Disclosure Letter”) (with specific reference to the particular section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information set forth in such disclosure letter relates (provided, that disclosure made with respect to any Section and/or subsection, will also be deemed to be disclosure against other sections and/or subsections of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is applicable to such other section and/or subsections), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows: (a)Organization, Standing and Corporate Power.The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or legal entity duly organized or formed, is validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, as the case may be, and has the requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and authority and possesses all governmental licenses, Permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to enable it to use its corporate or other name and to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its properties and other assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted, except with respect to its Subsidiaries, where the failure to have such governmental licenses, Permits, authorizations or approvals or to be so organized, existing and in good standing, or to have such power and authority, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize that concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or other assets makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

with outside legal and financial advisors) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and if the Company first receives from such third party a signed confidentiality agreement with such Person that contains confidentiality and standstill provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (an “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”), then the Company may (i) furnish non-public information to the third party making such Competing Proposal, if, and only if, the Company shall concurrently therewith provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to any such Person (or its Representatives) which had not

outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (y) if the Company receives a Competing Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal (A) effect a Company Recommendation Change and/or (B) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;provided, however, that the Board of Directors may not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change relating to a Competing Proposal pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or (y)(A) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y)(B) unless the Company shall have

its Representatives to, during such Notice Period, if requested by Parent, negotiate with Parent in good faith to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.Such notice in response to a Superior Proposal shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal) and shall attach the most current version of any proposed agreement pursuant to which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated.
