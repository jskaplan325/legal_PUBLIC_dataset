Income Tax Disclosure [Abstract]

Income Taxes
13. Income Taxes

The Company s income tax (provision) benefit totaled $(1,062) million, $923 million and $739 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company s effective income tax rate was approximately 14.3%, (16.5)% and 17.4% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The provision (benefit) for income taxes is presented in the following table:

 Years ended December 31,
(In millions) 2024 2023 2022
Current:
Federal income tax1
 $ 1,083 $ 809 $ 402
Foreign income tax2
 23 104 54
State and local income tax 55 64 59
 $ 1,161 $ 977 $ 515
Deferred:
Federal income tax (77) 331 (1,209)
Foreign income tax2
 (30) (2,239) 6
State and local income tax 8 8 (51)
 (99) (1,900) (1,254)
Total Income Tax Provision (Benefit) $ 1,062 $ (923) $ (739)

1 For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, current includes proportional amortization of $56 million, $49 million and $0 million, respectively; tax credits of $(367) million, $(186) million and $(16) million, respectively; and transaction costs relating to low-income housing and transferable energy tax credits of $248 million, $103 million and $0 million, respectively.

2 The foreign income tax provision (benefit) was calculated on $2,393 million, $2,600 million and $(3,359) million of pre-tax income (loss) generated in foreign jurisdictions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA ). The IRA contains a number of tax-related provisions, including a 15% minimum corporate income tax on certain large corporations ( CAMT ) as well as an excise tax on stock repurchases. Based on interpretations and assumptions the Company has made regarding the CAMT provisions of the IRA, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset and offsetting increase to current taxes owed but CAMT does not have a material impact to the effective tax rate. The excise tax has no material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

AHL changed its domicile from Bermuda to the United States, causing AHL to become a U.S.-domiciled corporation and a U.S. taxpayer effective December 31, 2023 (the Redomicile ) and is subject to U.S. corporate income tax for 2024 and future years. AHL s Bermuda subsidiaries (and AHL for pre-Redomicile periods) file protective U.S. income tax returns. AHL s U.S. subsidiaries file, and AHL for post-Redomicile periods will file, income tax returns with the U.S. federal government and various state governments.

On December 27, 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted the Corporate Income Tax Act of 2023 ( Bermuda CIT ). Commencing on January 1, 2025, the Bermuda CIT generally imposes a 15% corporate income tax on in-scope entities that are resident in Bermuda or have a Bermuda permanent establishment, without regard to any assurances that have been given pursuant to the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966. The Company s results as of December 31, 2024 include material deferred tax assets resulting from the passage of the Bermuda CIT, primarily related to an opening tax loss carryforward.

The U.K. enacted legislation in July 2023 implementing certain provisions of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development s Pillar Two global minimum tax initiative ( Pillar Two ) that applies to multinational enterprises for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023. On February 22, 2024, the U.K. enacted certain amendments to its Pillar Two legislation which similarly took effect for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2024. The Company continues to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of Pillar Two, pending legislative adoption by individual countries, as such legislative changes could result in changes to our effective tax rate. The Company evaluated the enacted legislation and concluded there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The primary jurisdictions in which the Company operates and incurs income taxes are the United States, the United Kingdom, and Bermuda (beginning January 1, 2025). There are no material unremitted earnings with respect to the United Kingdom or other foreign jurisdictions. The Company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by certain foreign subsidiaries, which are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. As such, no deferred taxes have been recorded related to the accumulated undistributed earnings. The Company determined that estimating the unrecognized tax liability is not practicable.

The following table reconciles the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate to the effective income tax rate:

 Years ended December 31,
 (In millions, except percentages) 2024 2023 2022
U.S. federal statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %
Income passed through to non-controlling interests (3.5) (4.6) (9.0)

Redomicile 0.1 (1.2)
Other (0.3) (1.0) (1.9)
Effective income tax rate 14.3 % (16.5) % 17.4 %

The income tax provision (benefit) is presented in the following table:

 Years ended December 31,
(In millions) 2024 2023 2022
Income tax provision (benefit) $ 1,062 $ (923) $ (739)
Income tax provision (benefit) from other comprehensive income (loss) 21 513 (1,933)
Total income tax provision (benefit) $ 1,083 $ (410) $ (2,672)

Deferred income taxes are recorded due to temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated statements of financial condition. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years.

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities. As of December 31, 2024, the Company s U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax returns for the years 2021 through 2023 are open under the general statute of limitations provisions and therefore subject to examination. Currently, the Internal Revenue Service is examining the tax returns of the Company and certain subsidiaries for tax years 2019 to 2021. The State and City of New York are examining certain subsidiaries tax returns for tax years 2014 to 2021. The United Kingdom tax authorities are currently examining certain subsidiaries tax returns for tax years 2015 to 2022. There are other examinations ongoing in other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates. No provisions with respect to these examinations have been recorded, other than the unrecognized tax benefits discussed below.

The following table presents a roll-forward of the beginning and ending aggregate unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented:

 Years ended December 31,
(In millions) 2024 2023 2022
Balance at beginning of period $ 19 $ 15 $

Increases based on tax positions taken in the prior years 8 4 15

Decreases due to settlements with tax authorities (17)

Balance at end of period $ 10 $ 19 $ 15

The Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $11 million and $23 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that a decrease up to $10 million of unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized within the next twelve months. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company accrued interest of $4 million and $10 million, respectively.
