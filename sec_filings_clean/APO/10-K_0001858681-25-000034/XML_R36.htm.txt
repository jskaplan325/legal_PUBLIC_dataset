Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, and Governance [Line Items]

Cybersecurity Risk Management Processes for Assessing, Identifying, and Managing Threats [Text Block]
AGM s board of directors is involved in overseeing the Company s risk management program, including with respect to cybersecurity, which is a critical component of the Company s overall approach to enterprise risk management ( ERM ). For additional information about our risk management framework, see Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Risk Management Framework. Our cybersecurity policies and practices are fully integrated into our ERM framework through our reporting, risk management and oversight channels and are based, in part, on recognized frameworks established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the International Organization for Standardization and other applicable industry standards.
As one of the critical elements of the Company s overall ERM approach, the Company s cybersecurity program is focused on the following key areas:

 Governance. As discussed further under the heading Cybersecurity Governance , our board of directors has an oversight role, as a whole and also at the committee level, in overseeing management of AGM s risks, including our cybersecurity risks. AGM s Chief Information Security Officer ( CISO ) and AHL s CISO, with support from the broader Technology team, are responsible for information security strategy, policies and practices.
 Collaborative Approach. The Company utilizes a cross-functional approach involving stakeholders across multiple departments, including Compliance, Legal, Technology, Operations, Risk and others, aimed at identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and incidents, while also implementing controls and procedures that provide for the prompt escalation of potentially material cybersecurity incidents so that decisions regarding the public disclosure and reporting of such incidents can be made by management in a timely manner.
 Technical Safeguards. The Company deploys technical safeguards that are designed to protect the Company s information systems from cybersecurity threats, including firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, anti-malware functionality and access controls, which are evaluated and improved on an ongoing basis using vulnerability assessments and cybersecurity threat intelligence.
 Incident Response and Recovery Planning. The Company has established and maintains incident response and recovery plans that address the Company s response to a cybersecurity incident, and such plans are tested and evaluated on a regular basis.
 Third-Party Risk Management. The Company maintains a risk-based approach to identifying and overseeing cybersecurity risks presented by third parties, including vendors, service providers and other external users of the Company s systems, as well as the systems of third parties that could adversely impact our business in the event of a cybersecurity incident affecting those third-party systems.
 Education and Awareness. The Company provides regular, mandatory training for personnel regarding cybersecurity threats to equip the Company s personnel with effective tools to help mitigate cybersecurity threats, and to communicate the Company s evolving information security policies, standards, processes and practices.

The Company engages in the periodic assessment and testing of the Company s policies and practices that are designed to address cybersecurity threats and incidents. These efforts include a wide range of activities, including audits, assessments, tabletop exercises, threat modeling, vulnerability testing and other exercises focused on evaluating the effectiveness of our cybersecurity measures. The Company regularly engages third parties, including auditors and consultants, to perform assessments on our cybersecurity measures, including information security maturity assessments, audits and independent reviews of our information security control environment and operating effectiveness. The results of such assessments, audits and reviews are reported to the Company s risk management function, and the Company adjusts its cybersecurity policies and practices as necessary based on the information provided by these assessments, audits and reviews.
Cybersecurity threat risks have not materially affected the Company, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. For further discussion of the risks we face from cybersecurity threats, including those that could materially affect the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Operating Risks We rely on technology and information systems, many of which are controlled by third-party vendors, to maintain the security of our information and technology networks and to conduct our businesses, and any failures or interruptions of these systems could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.
