1 Includes $27 million and $37 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to a receivable from a fund in connection with the Company s sale of a platform investment to such fund. The amount is payable to the Company over five years and is held at fair value.

2 Includes $175 million as of December 31, 2023 related to the AOG Unit Payment, which was payable in equal quarterly installments through December 31, 2024.

Tax Receivable Agreement

All Apollo Operating Group entities have made, or will make, an election under Section 754 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ). The election results in an increase to the tax basis of underlying assets which will reduce the amount of gain and associated tax that AGM and its subsidiaries will otherwise be required to pay in the future.

The tax receivable agreement ( TRA ) provides for payment to the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners of 85% of the amount of cash tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes the Company realizes as a result of the increases in tax basis of assets resulting from exchanges of AOG Units for Class A shares that have occurred in prior years. AGM and its subsidiaries retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of actual cash tax savings. If the Company does not make the required annual payment on a timely basis as outlined in the tax receivable agreement, interest is accrued on the balance until the payment date.
Following the closing of the Mergers, as the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners no longer own AOG Units, there were no new exchanges subject to the TRA.

AOG Unit Payment

On December 31, 2021, holders of AOG Units (other than Athene and the Company) sold and transferred a portion of such AOG Units to a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company, in exchange for an amount equal to $3.66 multiplied by the total number of AOG Units held by such holders immediately prior to such transaction. The remainder of the AOG Units held by such holders were exchanged for shares of AGM common stock concurrently with the consummation of the Mergers on January 1, 2022.

As of December 31, 2024, the outstanding payable amount due to Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners was fully paid with no remaining amounts outstanding.

Due from Employees and Former Employees

As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, due from related parties includes various amounts due to Apollo, including employee loans and return of profit-sharing distributions. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance includes interest-bearing employee loans receivable of $4 million and $3 million, respectively. The outstanding principal amount of the loans as well as all accrued and unpaid interest is required to be repaid on a specified date, either during the relevant employee s tenure or at the date of the relevant employee s resignation, in accordance with the contractual terms of each respective loan arrangement.

The receivable from certain employees and former employees includes an amount for the potential return of profit-sharing distributions that would be due if certain funds were liquidated of $94 million and $99 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Indemnity

Certain of the performance revenues Apollo earns from funds may be subject to repayment by its subsidiaries that are general partners of the funds in the event that certain specified return thresholds are not ultimately achieved. The Former Managing Partners, Contributing Partners and certain other investment professionals have personally guaranteed, subject to certain limitations, the obligations of these subsidiaries in respect of this obligation. Such guarantees are several and not joint and are limited to a particular individual s distributions. Apollo has agreed to indemnify each of the Former Managing Partners and certain Contributing Partners against all amounts that they pay pursuant to any of these personal guarantees in favor of certain funds that it manages (including costs and expenses related to investigating the basis for or objecting to any claims made in respect of the guarantees) for all interests that the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners contributed or sold to the Apollo Operating Group.

Apollo recorded an indemnification liability of $0.4 million and $0.3 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Due to Related Parties

Based upon an assumed liquidation of certain of the funds Apollo manages, it has recorded a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance allocations, which represents amounts due to certain funds. The obligation is recognized based upon an assumed liquidation of a fund s net assets as of the reporting date. The actual determination and any required payment would not take place until the final disposition of a fund s investments based on the contractual termination of the fund or as otherwise set forth in the respective governing document of the fund.

Apollo recorded general partner obligations to return previously distributed performance allocations related to certain funds of $213 million and $174 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Athora

Apollo, through ISGI, provides investment advisory services to certain portfolio companies of funds managed by Apollo and Athora, a strategic liabilities platform that acquires or reinsures blocks of insurance business in the German and broader
European life insurance market (collectively, the Athora Accounts ). AAM and its subsidiaries had equity commitments outstanding to Athora of up to $331 million as of December 31, 2024, subject to certain conditions.

Athora Sub-Advised

Apollo provides sub-advisory services with respect to a portion of the assets in certain portfolio companies of funds managed by Apollo and the Athora Accounts. Apollo broadly refers to Athora Sub-Advised assets as those assets in the Athora Accounts which Apollo explicitly sub-advises as well as those assets in the Athora Accounts which are invested directly in funds and investment vehicles Apollo manages.

Apollo earns a base management fee on the aggregate market value of substantially all of the investment accounts of or relating to Athora and also a sub-advisory fee on the Athora Sub-Advised assets, which varies depending on the specific asset class.

See Athora in the Retirement Services section below for further details on Athene s relationship with Athora.

Regulated Entities and Affiliated Service Providers

Apollo Global Securities, LLC ( AGS ) is a registered broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, subject to the minimum net capital requirements of the SEC. AGS was in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2024.

MidCap Financial

During the second quarter of 2023, the Company modified a performance allocation arrangement with MidCap Financial which included a reversal of unrealized performance allocations of $124 million. This resulted in a modification to the calculation of performance allocations beginning in June 2023 to be based solely on net income.

Investment in SPACs

Apollo previously sponsored and consolidated SPACs, as described below.

In October 2020, APSG I, a SPAC sponsored by Apollo, completed an IPO, ultimately raising total gross proceeds of $817 million. APSG Sponsor, L.P., a subsidiary of Apollo, held Class B ordinary shares of APSG I, and consolidated it as a VIE. In May 2022, APSG I completed a business combination with American Express Global Business Travel. As a result of the business combination, Apollo no longer consolidates APSG I as a VIE. The deconsolidation resulted in an unrealized gain of $162 million, which includes $82 million of unrealized gains related to previously held Class B ordinary shares, which converted to Class A ordinary shares of the newly merged entity, presented in net gains from investment activities within Other income (loss) - Asset Management in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. Apollo continues to hold a non-controlling interest in the merged entity at fair value, elected under the fair value option, which is primarily presented within Investments (Asset Management) in the consolidated statements of financial condition.

On February 12, 2021, APSG II, a SPAC sponsored by Apollo, completed an IPO, raising total gross proceeds of $690 million. APSG Sponsor II, L.P., a subsidiary of Apollo, held Class B ordinary shares of APSG II, and consolidated APSG II as a VIE. In May 2023, APSG II amended its articles of association to extend the completion window for an initial business combination until February 12, 2024. Also in May 2023, shareholders holding an aggregate of 51,089,882 of APSG II s Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares. The remaining 17,910,118 Class A ordinary shares were liquidated in November 2023. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recognized a loss of $31 million.

On July 13, 2021, Acropolis Infrastructure Acquisition Corp. ( Acropolis ), a SPAC sponsored by Apollo, completed an IPO, ultimately raising total gross proceeds of $345 million. Acropolis Infrastructure Acquisition Sponsor, L.P., a subsidiary of Apollo, held Class B common stock of Acropolis, and consolidated Acropolis as a VIE. In June 2023, Acropolis amended its
certificate of incorporation to extend the completion window for an initial business combination until July 13, 2024. Also in June 2023, shareholders holding an aggregate of 26,499,201 shares of Acropolis Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem their shares. The remaining 8,000,799 shares of Class A common stock were liquidated in December 2023. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recognized a loss of $9 million.

Retirement Services

AAA

Athene consolidates AAA as a VIE and AAA holds the majority of Athene s alternative investment portfolio. Apollo established AAA to provide a single vehicle through which investors may participate in a portfolio of alternative investments, including those managed by Apollo. Additionally, the Company believes AAA enhances its ability to increase alternative assets under management by raising capital from third parties, which allows it to achieve greater scale and diversification for alternatives. During the third quarter of 2024, AAA underwent a restructuring which resulted in a change in consolidation that reduced Athene s non-controlling interests by $1.1 billion and does not represent a withdrawal from AAA.

Athora

Athene has a cooperation agreement with Athora, pursuant to which, among other things, (1) for a period of 30 days from the receipt of notice of a cession, Athene has the right of first refusal to reinsure (i) up to 50% of the liabilities ceded from Athora s reinsurance subsidiaries to Athora Life Re Ltd. and (ii) up to 20% of the liabilities ceded from a third party to any of Athora s insurance subsidiaries, subject to a limitation in the aggregate of 20% of Athora s liabilities, (2) Athora agreed to cause its insurance subsidiaries to consider the purchase of certain funding agreements and/or other spread instruments issued by Athene s insurance subsidiaries, subject to a limitation that the fair market value of such funding agreements purchased by any of Athora s insurance subsidiaries may generally not exceed 3% of the fair market value of such subsidiary s total assets, and (3) Athene provides Athora with a right of first refusal to pursue acquisition and reinsurance transactions in Europe (other than the U.K.). Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the cooperation agreement, Athora is only required to use its reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries to adhere to the provisions set forth in the cooperation agreement and therefore Athora s ability to cause its subsidiaries to act pursuant to the cooperation agreement may be limited by, among other things, legal prohibitions or the inability to obtain the approval of the board of directors or other applicable governing body of the applicable subsidiary, which approval is solely at the discretion of such governing body. As of December 31, 2024, Athene had not exercised its right of first refusal to reinsure liabilities ceded to Athora s insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries.
The following table summarizes Athene s investments in Athora:

(In millions) December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023
Investment fund $ 1,033 $ 1,082
Non-redeemable preferred equity and corporate debt securities 277 249
Total investment in Athora $ 1,310 $ 1,331

Additionally, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Athene had $57 million and $61 million, respectively, of funding agreements outstanding to Athora. Athene also has commitments to make additional investments in Athora of $502 million as of December 31, 2024.

Atlas

Athene has an equity investment in Atlas, an asset-backed specialty lender, through its investment in AAA and, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Athene held $3.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, of AFS securities issued by Atlas. Athene also held $724 million and $921 million of reverse repurchase agreements issued by Atlas as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, Athene has commitments to make additional investments in Atlas of $3.0 billion. Additionally, see note 19 for further information on assurance letters issued in support of Atlas.

Catalina

Athene has an investment in Apollo Rose II (B) ( Apollo Rose ). Apollo Rose holds common and preferred equity interests in Catalina. During the third quarter of 2024, Athene distributed $141 million of its investment in Apollo Rose representing Catalina common equity interests, which is subsequently held by an asset management subsidiary of AGM.

Athene has a strategic modco reinsurance agreement with Catalina to cede certain inforce funding agreements. Athene elected the fair value option on this agreement and had a liability of $221 million and $330 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. During the first quarter of 2024, Athene entered into a modco reinsurance agreement with Catalina to cede a quota share of retail deferred annuity products. As of December 31, 2024, Athene had a reinsurance recoverable balance of $4.3 billion related to this agreement.

Skylign

Athene has investments in Skylign Aviation Holdings, LP ( Skylign ), a leading aviation finance group focused on aviation lending and leasing, both directly through notes issued by PK AirFinance, a subsidiary of Skylign, and indirectly through AAA, as Athene contributed certain of its investments in PK AirFinance to AAA during the second quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Athene held $1.6 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of Skylign senior notes, which are included in investments in related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Athene has commitments to make additional investments in Skylign of $40 million as of December 31, 2024.

Venerable

VA Capital Company LLC ( VA Capital ) is owned by a consortium of investors, led by affiliates of Apollo, Crestview Partners III Management, LLC and Reverence Capital Partners L.P., and is the parent of Venerable. Athene has a minority equity investment in VA Capital, which was $178 million and $181 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that is included in investments in related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition and accounted for as an equity method investment. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2024, Athene purchased an interest in AP Violet ATH Holdings, LP from Athora. Athene consolidated AP Violet ATH Holdings, L.P. as of December 31, 2024 and its investment of $106 million primarily represents an interest in VA Capital.

Athene also has coinsurance and modco agreements with VIAC, which is a subsidiary of Venerable. VIAC is a related party due to Athene s investment in VA Capital. Effective July 1, 2023, VIAC recaptured $2.7 billion of reserves, which represents a portion of their business that was subject to those coinsurance and modco agreements. Athene recognized a gain of $555 million, which is included in other revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of the settlement of the recapture agreement. As a result of Athene s intent to transfer the assets supporting this business to
VIAC in connection with the recapture, Athene was required by U.S. GAAP to recognize the unrealized losses on these assets of $104 million as intent-to-sell impairments in the second quarter of 2023.

Additionally, Athene has term loans receivable from Venerable due in 2033, which are included in investments in related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The loans are held at fair value and were $331 million and $343 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. While management viewed the overall transactions with Venerable as favorable to Athene, the stated interest rate of 6.257% on the initial term loan to Venerable represented a below-market interest rate, and management considered such rate as part of its evaluation and pricing of the reinsurance transactions.

Wheels

Athene invests in Wheels indirectly through its investment in AAA. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Athene also owned $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, of AFS securities issued by Wheels, which are included in investments in related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Athene also has commitments to make additional investments in Wheels of $100 million as of December 31, 2024.
