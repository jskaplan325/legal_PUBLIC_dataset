1 See note 16 for information regarding quarterly dividends.

2 Participating securities consist of vested and unvested RSUs that have rights to dividends and unvested restricted shares.

3 No allocation of undistributed losses was made to the participating securities in 2022 as the holders do not have a contractual obligation to share in the losses of the Company with common stockholders.

4 For the year ended December 31, 2022, all of the classes of securities were determined to be anti-dilutive.

The Company has granted RSUs that provide the right to receive, subject to vesting during continued employment, shares of common stock pursuant to the Equity Plan.

Any dividend equivalent paid to an employee on RSUs will not be returned to the Company upon forfeiture of the award by the employee. Vested and unvested RSUs that are entitled to non-forfeitable dividend equivalents qualify as participating securities and are included in the Company s basic and diluted earnings per share computations using the two-class method. The holder of an RSU participating security would have a contractual obligation to share in the losses of the entity if the holder is obligated to fund the losses of the issuing entity or if the contractual principal or mandatory redemption amount of the participating security is reduced as a result of losses incurred by the issuing entity. The RSU participating securities do not have a mandatory redemption amount and the holders of the participating securities are not obligated to fund losses; therefore, neither the vested RSUs nor the unvested RSUs are subject to any contractual obligation to share in losses of the Company.
The following table summarizes the anti-dilutive securities:

 Years ended December 31,
 2024 2023 2022
Weighted average unvested RSUs 14,273,743 15,316,350 13,664,334
Weighted average unexercised options 2,422,343
Weighted average unexercised warrants 63,388 4,761,918 2,279,452

Weighted average unvested restricted shares 1,327,484 1,688,421 2,114,622
Weighted average contingent shares outstanding 190,468
