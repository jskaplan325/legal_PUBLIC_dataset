1 AGM issued one-time grants of fully vested RSUs and options to certain executives and stockholders of Athene vesting upon consummation of the Mergers. Additionally, all issued and outstanding warrants of Athene prior to the Merger Date were exchanged for shares of AGM common stock at the time of the Mergers. The fair value of these awards is $600 million and is treated as part of consideration transferred.

2 AGM issued replacement awards for all outstanding Athene equity awards. $99 million was included as part of consideration for the portion that was attributable to pre-combination services and $53 million will be treated as post-combination compensation expense.

3 The pre-existing relationship related to receivables, payables, and dividends between Apollo and Athene. Total fees payable to AGM by Athene for asset management and advisory services were approximately $146 million. A cash dividend of $750 million was declared by Athene to its common stockholders with Apollo owning 100% of the common shares as of the dividend record date.

4 Based on the December 31, 2021 closing price of AHL common shares on the NYSE.

5 Other adjustments includes pushdown of goodwill arising out of deferred tax liabilities associated with identifiable net assets of Athene.

6 Non-controlling interest in Athene includes holders of Athene s preferred shares and third-party investors in ACRA 1 and in consolidated VIEs of Athene. The fair value of Athene s preferred shares was based on the closing stock price of Athene s preferred shares immediately prior to the consummation of the Athene merger and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in ACRA 1 was determined using the discounted distribution model approach.
