Financial Instruments Without Readily Determinable Fair Values

The Company elected the measurement alternative for certain equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The equity securities are held at cost less any impairment. The carrying amount of the equity securities was $358 million, net of an impairment of $42 million, as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As a result of slower than expected growth of the investee, Athene recorded an impairment of $42 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.

The fair value for financial instruments not carried at fair value are estimated using the same methods and assumptions as those carried at fair value. The financial instruments presented above are reported at carrying value on the consolidated statements of financial condition; however, in the case of policy loans, funds withheld at interest and liability, short-term investments, and securities to repurchase, the carrying amount approximates fair value.

Interest sensitive contract liabilities The carrying and fair value of interest sensitive contract liabilities above includes fixed indexed and traditional fixed annuities without mortality or morbidity risks, funding agreements and payout annuities without life contingencies. The embedded derivatives within fixed indexed annuities without mortality or morbidity risks are excluded, as they are carried at fair value. The valuation of these investment contracts is based on discounted cash flow methodologies using significant unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value is determined using current market risk-free interest rates, adding a spread to reflect nonperformance risk and subtracting a risk margin to reflect uncertainty inherent in the projected cash flows.

Debt The fair value of debt is obtained from commercial pricing services. See note 14 for further information on debt.

Significant Unobservable Inputs

Asset Management

Discounted Cash Flow and Direct Capitalization Model

When a discounted cash flow or direct capitalization model is used to determine fair value, the significant input used in the valuation model is the discount rate applied to present value the projected cash flows or the capitalization rate, respectively. Increases in the discount or capitalization rate can significantly lower the fair value of an investment and the contingent consideration obligations; conversely decreases in the discount or capitalization rate can significantly increase the fair value of an investment and the contingent consideration obligations. See note 19 for further discussion of the contingent consideration obligations.

Option Model

When an option model is used to determine fair value, the significant input used in the valuation model is the volatility rate applied to present value the projected cash flows. Increases in the volatility rate can significantly lower the fair value of an investment and the contingent consideration obligations; conversely decreases in the discount or capitalization rate can significantly increase the fair value of an investment and the contingent consideration obligations.
Consolidated VIEs Investments

The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the equity securities, bank loans and bonds is the discount rate applied in the valuation models. This input in isolation can cause significant increases or decreases in fair value, which would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The discount rate is determined based on the market rates an investor would expect for a similar investment with similar risks.

NAV

Certain investments and investments of VIEs are valued using the NAV per share equivalent calculated by the investment manager as a practical expedient to determine an independent fair value.

Retirement Services

AFS, trading and equity securities

Athene uses discounted cash flow models to calculate the fair value for certain fixed maturity and equity securities. The discount rate is a significant unobservable input because the credit spread includes adjustments made to the base rate. The base rate represents a market comparable rate for securities with similar characteristics. This excludes assets for which fair value is provided by independent broker quotes.

Mortgage loans

Athene uses discounted cash flow models from independent commercial pricing services to calculate the fair value of its mortgage loan portfolio. The discount rate is a significant unobservable input. This approach uses market transaction information and client portfolio-oriented information, such as prepayments or defaults, to support the valuations.

Interest sensitive contract liabilities embedded derivative

Significant unobservable inputs used in the fixed indexed annuities embedded derivative of the interest sensitive contract liabilities valuation include:

1.Nonperformance risk For contracts Athene issues, it uses the credit spread, relative to the U.S. Treasury curve based on Athene s public credit rating as of the valuation date. This represents Athene s credit risk for use in the estimate of the fair value of embedded derivatives.
2.Option budget Athene assumes future hedge costs in the derivative s fair value estimate. The level of option budgets determines the future costs of the options and impacts future policyholder account value growth.
3.Policyholder behavior Athene regularly reviews the full withdrawal (surrender rate) assumptions. These are based on initial pricing assumptions updated for actual experience. Actual experience may be limited for recently issued products.

Valuation of Underlying Investments

Asset Management

As previously noted, the underlying entities that Apollo manages and invests in are primarily investment companies that account for their investments at estimated fair value.

On a quarterly basis, valuation committees consisting of members from senior management review and approve the valuation results related to the investments of the funds Apollo manages. Apollo also retains external valuation firms to provide third-party valuation consulting services to Apollo, which consist of certain limited procedures that management identifies and requests them to perform. The limited procedures provided by the external valuation firms assist management with validating their valuation results or determining fair value. Apollo performs various back-testing procedures to validate their valuation approaches, including comparisons between expected and observed outcomes, forecast evaluations and variance analyses. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the differences could be material.
Credit Investments

Credit investments are generally valued based on third-party vendor prices and/or quoted market prices and valuation models. Valuations using quoted market prices are based on the average of the bid and the ask quotes provided by multiple brokers wherever possible without any adjustments. Apollo will designate certain brokers to use to value specific securities. In determining the designated brokers, Apollo considers the following: (i) brokers with which Apollo has previously transacted, (ii) the underwriter of the security and (iii) active brokers indicating executable quotes. In addition, when valuing a security based on broker quotes wherever possible Apollo tests the standard deviation amongst the quotes received and the variance between the concluded fair value and the value provided by a pricing service. When relying on a third-party vendor as a primary source, Apollo (i) analyzes how the price has moved over the measurement period, (ii) reviews the number of brokers included in the pricing service s population, if available, and (iii) validates the valuation levels with Apollo s pricing team and traders.

Debt securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value utilizing a model-based approach to determine fair value. Valuation approaches used to estimate the fair value of illiquid credit investments also may include the income approach, as described below. The valuation approaches used consider, as applicable, market risks, credit risks, counterparty risks and foreign currency risks.

Equity Investments

The majority of illiquid equity investments are valued using the market approach and/or the income approach, as described below.

Market Approach

The market approach is driven by current market conditions, including actual trading levels of similar companies and, to the extent available, actual transaction data of similar companies. Judgment is required by management when assessing which companies are similar to the subject company being valued. Consideration may also be given to any of the following factors: (1) the subject company s historical and projected financial data; (2) valuations given to comparable companies; (3) the size and scope of the subject company s operations; (4) the subject company s individual strengths and weaknesses; (5) expectations relating to the market s receptivity to an offering of the subject company s securities; (6) applicable restrictions on transfer; (7) industry and market information; (8) general economic and market conditions; and (9) other factors deemed relevant. Market approach valuation models typically employ a multiple that is based on one or more of the factors described above.

Enterprise value as a multiple of EBITDA is common and relevant for most companies and industries, however, other industry specific multiples are employed where available and appropriate. Sources for gaining additional knowledge related to comparable companies include public filings, annual reports, analyst research reports and press releases. Once a comparable company set is determined, Apollo reviews certain aspects of the subject company s performance and determines how its performance compares to the group and to certain individuals in the group. Apollo compares certain measurements such as EBITDA margins, revenue growth over certain time periods, leverage ratios and growth opportunities. In addition, Apollo compares the entry multiple and its relation to the comparable set at the time of acquisition to understand its relation to the comparable set on each measurement date.

Income Approach

The income approach provides an indication of fair value based on the present value of cash flows that a business or security is expected to generate in the future. The most widely used methodology for the income approach is a discounted cash flow method. Inherent in the discounted cash flow method are significant assumptions related to the subject company s expected results, the determination of a terminal value and a calculated discount rate, which is normally based on the subject company s WACC. The WACC represents the required rate of return on total capitalization, which is comprised of a required rate of return on equity, plus the current tax-effected rate of return on debt, weighted by the relative percentages of equity and debt that are typical in the industry. The most critical step in determining the appropriate WACC for each subject company is to select companies that are comparable in nature to the subject company and the credit quality of the subject company. Sources for gaining additional knowledge about the comparable companies include public filings, annual reports, analyst research reports and press releases. The general formula then used for calculating the WACC considers the after-tax rate of return on debt capital and the rate of return on common equity capital, which further considers the risk-free rate of return, market beta, market
risk premium and small stock premium, if applicable. The variables used in the WACC formula are inferred from the comparable market data obtained. The Company evaluates the comparable companies selected and concludes on WACC inputs based on the most comparable company or analyzes the range of data for the investment.

The value of liquid investments, where the primary market is an exchange (whether foreign or domestic), is determined using period end market prices. Such prices are generally based on the close price on the date of determination.

Certain of the funds Apollo manages may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts, total return swap contracts, credit default swap contracts and other derivative contracts, which may include options, caps, collars and floors. Foreign currency exchange contracts are marked-to-market by recognizing the difference between the contract exchange rate and the current market rate as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. If securities are held at the end of the period, the changes in value are recorded in income as unrealized. Realized gains or losses are recognized when contracts are settled. Total return swap and credit default swap contracts are recorded at fair value as an asset or liability with changes in fair value recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Realized gains or losses are recognized at the termination of the contract based on the difference between the close-out price of the total return or credit default swap contract and the original contract price. Forward contracts are valued based on market rates obtained from counterparties or prices obtained from recognized financial data service providers.

Retirement Services

AFS and trading securities

The fair values for most marketable securities without an active market are obtained from several commercial pricing services. These are classified as Level 2 assets. The pricing services incorporate a variety of market observable information in their valuation techniques, including benchmark yields, trading activity, credit quality, issuer spreads, bids, offers and other reference data. This category typically includes U.S. and non-U.S. corporate bonds, U.S. agency and government guaranteed securities, CLO, ABS, CMBS and RMBS.

Athene also has fixed maturity securities priced based on indicative broker quotes or by employing market accepted valuation models. For certain fixed maturity securities, the valuation model uses significant unobservable inputs and these are included in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Significant unobservable inputs used include discount rates, issue-specific credit adjustments, material non-public financial information, estimation of future earnings and cash flows, default rate assumptions, liquidity assumptions and indicative quotes from market makers.

Privately placed fixed maturity securities are valued based on the credit quality and duration of comparable marketable securities, which may be securities of another issuer with similar characteristics. In some instances, a matrix-based pricing model is used. These models consider the current level of risk-free interest rates, corporate spreads, credit quality of the issuer and cash flow characteristics of the security. Additional factors such as net worth of the borrower, value of collateral, capital structure of the borrower, presence of guarantees and Athene s evaluation of the borrower s ability to compete in its relevant market are also considered. Privately placed fixed maturity securities are classified as Level 2 or 3.

Equity securities

Fair values of publicly traded equity securities are based on quoted market prices and classified as Level 1. Other equity securities, typically private equities or equity securities not traded on an exchange, are valued based on other sources, such as commercial pricing services or brokers, and are classified as Level 2 or 3.

Mortgage loans

Athene estimates fair value monthly using discounted cash flow analysis and rates being offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings. Loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for purposes of the calculations. The discounted cash flow model uses unobservable inputs, including estimates of discount rates and loan prepayments. Mortgage loans are classified as Level 3.
Investment funds

Investment funds are typically measured using NAV as a practical expedient in determining fair value and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value reflects a pro rata ownership percentage as indicated by NAV in the investment fund financial statements, which may be adjusted if it is determined NAV is not calculated consistent with investment company fair value principles. The underlying investments of the investment funds may have significant unobservable inputs, which may include but are not limited to, comparable multiples and WACC rates applied in valuation models or a discounted cash flow model.

Certain investment funds for which Athene has elected the fair value option are included in Level 3 and are priced based on market accepted valuation models. The valuation models use significant unobservable inputs, which include material non-public financial information, estimation of future distributable earnings and demographic assumptions.

Other investments

The fair values of other investments are determined using a discounted cash flow model using discount rates for similar investments.

Funds withheld at interest embedded derivatives

Funds withheld at interest embedded derivatives represent the right to receive or obligation to pay the total return on the assets supporting the funds withheld at interest or funds withheld liability, respectively, and are analogous to a total return swap with a floating rate leg. The fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld and modco agreements is measured as the unrealized gain (loss) on the underlying assets and classified as Level 3.

Derivatives

Derivative contracts can be exchange traded or over the counter. Exchange-traded derivatives typically fall within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy depending on trading activity. Over-the-counter derivatives are valued using valuation models or an income approach using third-party broker valuations. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlation of the inputs. Athene considers and incorporates counterparty credit risk in the valuation process through counterparty credit rating requirements and monitoring of overall exposure. Athene also evaluates and includes its own nonperformance risk in valuing derivatives. The majority of Athene s derivatives trade in liquid markets; therefore, it can verify model inputs and model selection does not involve significant management judgment. These are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Interest sensitive contract liabilities embedded derivatives

Embedded derivatives related to interest sensitive contract liabilities with fixed indexed annuity products are classified as Level 3. The valuations include significant unobservable inputs associated with economic assumptions and actuarial assumptions for policyholder behavior.

AmerUs Closed Block

Athene elected the fair value option for the future policy benefits liability in the AmerUs Closed Block. The valuation technique is to set the fair value of policyholder liabilities equal to the fair value of assets. There is an additional component which captures the fair value of the open block s obligations to the closed block business. This component is the present value of the projected release of required capital and future earnings before income taxes on required capital supporting the AmerUs Closed Block, discounted at a rate which represents a market participant s required rate of return, less the initial required capital. Unobservable inputs include estimates for these items. The AmerUs Closed Block policyholder liabilities and any corresponding reinsurance recoverable are classified as Level 3.

ILICO Closed Block

Athene elected the fair value option for the ILICO Closed Block. The valuation technique is to set the fair value of policyholder liabilities equal to the fair value of assets. There is an additional component which captures the fair value of the open block s obligations to the closed block business. This component uses the present value of future cash flows which include
commissions, administrative expenses, reinsurance premiums and benefits, and an explicit cost of capital. The discount rate includes a margin to reflect the business and nonperformance risk. Unobservable inputs include estimates for these items. The ILICO Closed Block policyholder liabilities and corresponding reinsurance recoverable are classified as Level 3.

Universal life liabilities and other life benefits

Athene elected the fair value option for certain blocks of universal and other life business ceded to Global Atlantic. Athene uses a present value of liability cash flows. Unobservable inputs include estimates of mortality, persistency, expenses, premium payments and a risk margin used in the discount rates that reflect the riskiness of the business. The universal life policyholder liabilities and corresponding reinsurance recoverable are classified as Level 3.

Other liabilities

Other liabilities include funds withheld liability embedded derivatives, as described above in funds withheld at interest embedded derivatives, and a ceded modco agreement of certain inforce funding agreement contracts for which Athene elected the fair value option. Athene estimates the fair value of the ceded modco agreement by discounting projected cash flows for net settlements and certain periodic and non-periodic payments. Unobservable inputs include estimates for asset portfolio returns and economic inputs used in the discount rate, including risk margin. Depending on the projected cash flows and other assumptions, the contract may be recorded as an asset or liability. The estimate is classified as Level 3.
