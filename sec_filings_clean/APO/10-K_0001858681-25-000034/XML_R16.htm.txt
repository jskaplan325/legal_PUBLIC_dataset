Reinsurance typically provides for recapture rights on the part of the ceding company for certain events of default. Additionally, some agreements require placement of assets in trust accounts for the benefit of the ceding entity. The required minimum assets are equal to or greater than statutory reserves, as defined by the agreement, and were $26.1 billion and $21.6 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Although Athene owns assets placed in trust, their use is restricted based on the trust agreement terms. If the statutory book value of the assets, or in certain cases fair value, in a trust declines because of impairments or other reasons, Athene may be required to contribute additional assets to the trust. In addition, the assets within a trust may be subject to a pledge in favor of the applicable reinsurance company.
Reinsurance transactions

Athene entered into a coinsurance agreement to reinsure a block of whole life policies during the fourth quarter of 2023. There were no block reinsurance transactions during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022. The following summarizes the block reinsurance agreement at inception:

Catalina

Athene has reinsurance agreements with certain affiliates of Catalina Holdings (Bermuda) Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries, Catalina ). See note 18 for further information on these reinsurance agreements.

Global Atlantic

Athene has a coinsurance and assumption agreement with Global Atlantic. The agreement ceded all existing open block life insurance business issued by AAIA, with the exception of enhanced guarantee universal life insurance products. Athene also entered into a coinsurance agreement with Global Atlantic to cede all policy liabilities of the ILICO Closed Block. The ILICO Closed Block consists primarily of participating whole life insurance policies. Athene also has an excess of loss arrangement with Global Atlantic to be reimbursed for any payments required from Athene s general assets to meet the contractual obligations of the AmerUs Closed Block not covered by existing reinsurance through Athene Re USA IV. The AmerUs Closed Block consists primarily of participating whole life insurance policies. Since all liabilities were covered by the existing reinsurance at close, no reinsurance premiums were ceded. The assets backing the AmerUs Closed Block are managed, on AAIA s behalf, by Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Global Atlantic maintained a series of trust and custody accounts under the terms of these agreements with assets equal to or greater than a required aggregate statutory balance of $2.5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.
