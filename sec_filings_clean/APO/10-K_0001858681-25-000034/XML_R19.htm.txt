Long-duration Contracts
11. Long-duration Contracts

Interest sensitive contract liabilities Interest sensitive contract liabilities primarily include:

 traditional deferred annuities,
 indexed annuities consisting of fixed indexed, index-linked variable annuities, and assumed indexed universal life without significant mortality risk,
 funding agreements, and
 other investment-type contracts comprising of immediate annuities without significant mortality risk (which includes pension group annuities without life contingencies) and assumed endowments without significant mortality risks.

The following represents a rollforward of the policyholder account balance by product within interest sensitive contract liabilities. Where explicit policyholder account balances do not exist, the disaggregated rollforward represents the recorded reserve.

Additionally, it includes term life reserves, fully ceded whole life reserves, and reserves for immaterial lines of business including accident and health and disability, as well as other insurance benefit reserves for no-lapse guarantees with universal life contracts, all of which are fully ceded.

The following is a reconciliation of premiums and interest expense relating to future policy benefits to the consolidated statements of operations:

1 Reconciling items primarily relate to immaterial lines of business including term life, fully ceded whole life, and accident and health and disability.

Significant assumptions and inputs to the calculation of future policy benefits for payout annuities with life contingencies include policyholder demographic data, assumptions for policyholder longevity and policyholder utilization for contracts with deferred lives, and discount rates. For whole life products, significant assumptions and inputs include policyholder demographic data, assumptions for mortality, morbidity, and lapse and discount rates.

Athene bases certain key assumptions related to policyholder behavior on industry standard data adjusted to align with actual company experience, if necessary. At least annually, Athene reviews all significant cash flow assumptions and updates as necessary, unless emerging experience indicates a more frequent review is necessary. The discount rate reflects market observable inputs from upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yields and is interpolated, where necessary, to conform to the duration of Athene s liabilities.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the present value of expected future policy benefits decreased by $3,400 million, which was driven by $4,561 million of benefit payments, a $1,440 million change in discount rate assumptions due to an increase in rates, and a $356 million change in foreign exchange, partially offset by $1,871 million of interest accrual and $1,115 million of issuances, primarily pension group annuities.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the present value of expected future policy benefits increased by $11,950 million, which was driven by $13,518 million of issuances, primarily pension group annuities, a $2,236 million change in discount rate assumptions related to a decrease in rates, and $1,664 million of interest accrual, partially offset by $3,852 million of benefit payments, a $1,509 million reduction in reserve related to recapture, and $297 million resulting from favorable unlocking of assumptions, primarily related to higher interest rates and favorable mortality experience lowering future benefit payments.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the present value of expected future policy benefits increased by $1,144 million, which was driven by $11,528 million of issuances, primarily pension group annuities, and $1,146 million of interest accrual, partially offset by an $8,425 million change in discount rate assumptions related to an increase in rates, and $2,921 million of benefit payments.

The following is a summary of remeasurement gains (losses) included within future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations:

Deferred profit liability (48) (246) (126)
Negative VOBA 39 (65) 21
Total remeasurement gains (losses) $ 16 $ 53 $ 15

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. Athene recorded reserve increases of $15 million, $136 million, and $50 million, respectively, on the consolidated statements of operations as a result of the present value of benefits and expenses exceeding the present value of gross premiums.
Market risk benefits Athene issues and reinsures traditional deferred and indexed annuity products that contain GLWB and GMDB riders that meet the criteria to be classified as market risk benefits.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, net market risk benefit liabilities increased by $342 million, which was primarily driven by $360 million in fees collected from policyholders, issuances of $295 million, $201 million of interest accrual, and a $149 million change in instrument-specific credit risk related to tightening of credit spreads, partially offset by a decrease of $658 million related to changes in the risk-free discount rate across the curve.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, net market risk benefit liabilities increased by $884 million, which was primarily driven by $338 million in fees collected from policyholders, a $374 million change in instrument-specific credit risk related to tightening of credit spreads, $157 million of interest accrual, and issuances of $106 million, partially offset by $119 million of changes related to equity market performance and a decrease of $91 million related to changes in the risk-free discount rate across the curve.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, net market risk benefit liabilities decreased by $1,958 million, which was primarily driven by a decrease of $2,169 million related to changes in the risk-free discount rate across the curve and a $366 million change in instrument-specific credit risk related to widening of credit spreads, partially offset by $333 million of fees collected from policyholders and $176 million of changes related to equity market performance.
The determination of the fair value of market risk benefits requires the use of inputs related to fees and assessments and assumptions in determining the projected benefits in excess of the projected account balance. Judgment is required for both economic and actuarial assumptions, which can be either observable or unobservable, that impact future policyholder account growth.

Economic assumptions include interest rates and implied volatilities throughout the duration of the liability. For indexed annuities, assumptions also include projected equity returns which impact cash flows attributable to indexed strategies, implied equity volatilities, expected index credits on the next policy anniversary date and future equity option costs. Assumptions related to the level of option budgets used for determining the future equity option costs and the impact on future policyholder account value growth are considered unobservable inputs.

Policyholder behavior assumptions are unobservable inputs and are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods to estimate withdrawals (surrender rate) and income rider utilization. Assumptions are generally based on industry data and pricing assumptions which are updated for actual experience, if necessary. Actual experience may be limited for recently issued products.

All inputs are used to project excess benefits and fees over a range of risk-neutral, stochastic interest rate scenarios. For indexed annuities, stochastic equity return scenarios are also included within the range. A risk margin is incorporated within the discount rate to reflect uncertainty in the projected cash flows such as variations in policyholder behavior, as well as a credit spread to reflect nonperformance risk, which is considered an unobservable input. Athene uses its public credit rating relative to the U.S. Treasury curve as of the valuation date to reflect its nonperformance risk in the fair value estimate of market risk benefits.

The following summarizes the unobservable inputs for market risk benefits:
