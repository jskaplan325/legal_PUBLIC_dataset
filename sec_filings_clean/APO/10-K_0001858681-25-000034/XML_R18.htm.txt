On January 1, 2022, the Company completed the previously announced merger transactions with Athene. In connection with the completion of the Mergers, the Company recognized goodwill of $4.1 billion as of the Merger Date. See note 3 for further disclosure regarding the goodwill recorded as a result of the Mergers.

In connection with the completion of the Mergers, the Company undertook a strategic review of its operating structure and business segments to assess the performance of its businesses and the allocation of resources. As a result, the Company reorganized into three reportable segments: Asset Management, Retirement Services, and Principal Investing. The Company conducted interim impairment testing immediately prior to and subsequent to the reorganization and determined there to be no impairment of historical goodwill.

Apollo acquired Griffin Capital s U.S. wealth distribution business and U.S. asset management business in two separate closings on March 1, 2022 and May 3, 2022 and recorded goodwill of $13 million and $134 million, respectively, on each acquisition date. All of the goodwill associated with the Griffin Capital acquisitions is included within the Asset Management segment.
