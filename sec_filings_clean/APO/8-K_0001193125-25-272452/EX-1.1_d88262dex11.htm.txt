 Ladies and Gentlemen:

 Apollo Global

are acting as representatives, (a) $400,000,000 principal amount of its 4.600% Senior Notes due 2031 (the 2031 Notes ) and (b) $350,000,000 principal amount of its 5.150% Senior Notes due 2035 (the 2035 Notes
and, together with the 2031 Notes, the Notes ). The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis (the Guarantees and together with the Notes, the Securities ) by Apollo Asset
Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Apollo Principal Holdings A, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, Apollo Principal Holdings B, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, Apollo Principal Holdings C, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, AMH
Holdings (Delaware), L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and Apollo Management Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (together, the Guarantors ). The 2035 Notes will constitute a further issuance of, and will be
consolidated and form a single series with, the 5.150% Senior Notes due 2035, of which $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount was issued by the Issuer on August 12, 2025 (the Existing 2035 Notes ). The terms of the 2035
Notes, other than their issue date and issue price, will be identical to the terms of the Existing 2035 Notes. Upon settlement, the 2035 Notes will have the same CUSIP number as, and will trade fungibly with, the Existing 2035 Notes. Immediately
after giving effect to the issuance of the 2035 Notes, the Issuer will have $850,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.150% Senior Notes due 2035 outstanding.

 The 2031 Notes are to be issued under an indenture, to be dated as of the Closing Date (as
defined below) (the 2031 Notes Indenture ), among the Issuer, the Guarantors and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the Trustee ). The 2035 Notes are to be issued pursuant to the
provisions of a supplemental indenture, to be entered into by and among the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee (the Supplemental Indenture ), to the indenture governing the Existing 2035 Notes, dated as of August 12,
2025, between the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee (as so supplemented, the 2035 Notes Indenture , and collectively with the 2031 Notes Indenture, the Indentures , and each, an
 Indenture ).

 The Issuer has prepared and filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-271275) covering the public offering and sale of certain securities, including the Securities, under the Act, which automatic shelf registration
statement became effective under Rule 462(e). Such registration statement, as of any time, means such registration statement as amended by any post-effective amendments thereto at such time, including the exhibits and any schedules thereto at such
time, the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein at such time pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Act and the documents otherwise deemed to be a part thereof as of such
time pursuant to Rule 430B, is referred to herein as the Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Registration Statement without reference to a time means such registration statement as
amended by any post-effective amendments thereto as of the time of the first contract of sale for the Securities, which time shall be considered the new effective date of such registration statement with respect to the Securities
within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2) of Rule 430B, including the exhibits and schedules thereto as of such time, the documents incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference therein at such time pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Act and the documents otherwise deemed to be a part thereof as of such time pursuant to the Rule 430B. Each preliminary prospectus used in connection with the offering of the Securities, including the
documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Act, are collectively referred to herein as a Preliminary Prospectus.
Promptly after execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Issuer will prepare and file a final prospectus relating to the Securities in accordance with the provisions of Rule 424(b). The final prospectus, in the form first furnished or made
available to the Underwriters for use in connection with the offering of the Securities, including the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3
under the Act, are collectively referred to herein as the Prospectus. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any
of the foregoing shall be deemed to include the copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system (or any successor system) ( EDGAR ).

All references in this Agreement to financial statements and schedules and other information which is contained,
 included or stated (or other references of like import) in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to include all such financial statements and schedules and other
information incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, prior to the Execution Time; and all references in this Agreement to amendments or
supplements to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to include the filing of any document under the

 2

Exchange Act, incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, such Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, at or after the Execution
Time. The use of the neuter in this Agreement shall include the feminine and masculine wherever appropriate. Certain terms used herein are defined in Section 25 hereof.

1. Representations and Warranties. Each of the Apollo Parties jointly and severally represents and warrants to and agrees with each of
the Underwriters that:

 (a) The Issuer meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Act.
The Registration Statement, including the Base Prospectus contained therein, is an automatic shelf registration statement (as defined in Rule 405) and the Securities have been and remain eligible for registration by the Issuer on such
automatic shelf registration statement. Such Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto has become effective under the Act. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
thereto has been issued under the Act, no order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus has been issued and no proceedings for any of those purposes have been instituted or are pending or, to the
Issuer s knowledge, contemplated. The Issuer has complied with each request (if any) from the Commission for additional information.

Each of the Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, at the time of its effectiveness and at each deemed effective
date with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2), complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Act. Each Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time each was filed
with the Commission, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and each Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus delivered to the Underwriters for use in connection with this offering was identical to the electronically
transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.

The documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, when they became
effective or at the time they were filed with the Commission, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

(b) Neither the Registration Statement nor any amendment thereto, at its effective time or on the Closing Date, contained, contains or will
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, omits or will omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. As of the Applicable Time, the Disclosure Package did
not include, includes or will include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, omits or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Neither the Prospectus nor any amendment or supplement thereto, as of its issue date, at the time of any filing with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), or on the Closing Date, included, includes or will include an untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted, omits or will omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 3

 The representations and warranties in this subsection 1(b) shall not apply to statements in
or omissions from the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Issuer by
any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information so furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in
Section 8(b) hereof.

 (c) No Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus, including any document incorporated by reference therein, and any preliminary or other prospectus deemed to be a part thereof that has not been superseded or modified. Any offer that is a written communication relating to the
Securities made prior to the initial filing of the Registration Statement by the Issuer or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this paragraph only, of Rule 163(c)) has been filed with the Commission in accordance with the
exemption provided by Rule 163 and otherwise complied with the requirements of Rule 163, including without limitation the legending requirement, to qualify such offer for the exemption from Section 5(c) of the Act provided by Rule 163. The
Issuer (including its agents and representatives, other than the Underwriters in their capacity as such) has not prepared, made, used, authorized, approved or referred to, and the Issuer will not prepare, make, use, authorize, approve or refer to,
any written communication that constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy the Securities other than (i) the Registration Statement, (ii) the Preliminary Prospectus, (iii) the Prospectus, (iv) any Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus and (v) any electronic road show or other written communications, in each case used in accordance with Section 5(m).

(d) (i) At the original effectiveness of the Registration Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the
purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), (iii) at the time the
Apollo Parties or any person acting on their behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c)) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption of Rule 163, and (iv) as of the Applicable Time, the Issuer
was and is a well-known seasoned issuer (as defined in Rule 405).

 (e) At the time of filing the Registration Statement and
any post-effective amendment thereto, at the earliest time thereafter that the Issuer or another offering participant made a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2)) of the Securities and at the date hereof, the Issuer was not and is
not an ineligible issuer, as defined in Rule 405.

 (f) The Issuer is subject to and in full compliance with the reporting
requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 (g) Since the respective dates as of which information is
given in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, none of the Apollo Entities has sustained any material loss or interference with its business, there have been no transactions entered into by any of the Apollo
Entities, other than those in the ordinary course of business, which are material with respect to the Apollo Entities taken as a whole and there has not been

 4

any change in the capital stock, other than any change pursuant to the Issuer s share repurchase program, or long term debt of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any material adverse
change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, net assets or results of operations of the Apollo Entities, taken as a whole, or the Issuer (each such
change or development, a Material Adverse Effect ).

 (h) Each of the Apollo Entities (i) has good and marketable
title to all personal property owned by it, in each case free and clear of all pledges, liens, security interests, claims, restrictions or encumbrances except such as are described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the
Prospectus or such as do not materially affect the value of such property and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by the Apollo Entities; and (ii) any real property and buildings held under lease by the
Apollo Entities are held by them under valid, subsisting and enforceable leases, with such exceptions in clauses (i) and (ii) as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; none of the Apollo Entities hold any ownership
interests in any material real property.

partnership in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and, except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, has been duly qualified as a foreign limited partnership or corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns

(j) Except in each case as described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock, partnership interests, member interests or other equity interests of each Subsidiary that are owned directly or indirectly by any Apollo Party (i) have
been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid (in the case of any Subsidiaries that are organized as limited liability companies, limited partnerships or other business entities, to the extent required under the applicable limited
liability company, limited partnership or other organizational agreement) and non-assessable (except in the case of interests held by general partners or similar entities under the applicable laws of other
jurisdictions, in the case of any Subsidiaries that are organized as limited liability companies, as such non-assessability may be affected by Section 18-607 or Section 18-804 of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act or similar provisions under the applicable laws of other

 5

jurisdictions or the applicable limited liability company agreement and, in the case of any Subsidiaries that are organized as limited partnerships, as such
non-assessability may be affected by Section 17-607 or Section 17-804 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited

encumbrance, security interest or any other claim of any third party.

 (k) Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement, the
Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights to purchase, agreements or other obligations to issue, or rights to convert any obligation into or exchange any securities for, limited partner
interests or other ownership interests in any of the Apollo Entities or any security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for partner interests or other ownership interests in any Apollo Entity.

(l) Prior to the date hereof, no Apollo Entity has and, to the best knowledge of the Apollo Parties, no Affiliate of an Apollo Entity and no
person acting on behalf of any Apollo Entity or any Affiliate of an Apollo Entity has (i) taken, directly or indirectly, any action designed to cause or to result in, or that has constituted or which might reasonably be expected to constitute,

constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which any Apollo Entity or any Apollo Fund is a party or by which any Apollo Entity or any Apollo Fund is bound or to which any of
the property or assets of any Apollo Entity or any Apollo Fund is subject, except for such conflicts, breaches or defaults that, singly or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, nor will such
action result in any violation of the provisions of the organizational documents of any Apollo Entity, or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over any Apollo Entity or any of
their properties, except, other than in the case of any organizational documents of any Apollo Entity, such violations that, singly or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; no consent, approval,
authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, or the Indentures by each Apollo Party or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein or therein by each Apollo Party, except for (i) any such consents, approvals, authorizations, filings or orders the absence of which would not, singly or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a

 (r) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Apollo Parties.

(s) Each Indenture has been duly authorized by each of the Apollo Parties and has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee, when executed and delivered by each of the Apollo Parties, will constitute a legal, valid, binding instrument enforceable against each of the Apollo Parties in

of equity).

 7

 (t) The Notes have been duly authorized, and, when executed and authenticated in accordance
with the provisions of the applicable Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters, will have been duly executed and delivered by the Issuer and will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer entitled to the

(v) None of the Apollo Parties is, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds

(w) Deloitte & Touche LLP, who have issued an independent auditors report on the financial statements of the Issuer and its
subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024,
are independent public accountants as required by the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

 (x) Each of the
Apollo Entities maintains systems of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act and have
been designed by, or under the supervision of, their respective principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, including, but not limited to internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with management s general or specific authorization, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management s general or specific authorization and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

 (y) Since the date of
the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there are no material weaknesses in the Issuer s internal control over financial reporting.
The Issuer s auditors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Issuer have been advised of: (i) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting
which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Issuer s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Issuer s internal control over financial reporting.

 8

 (z) The Issuer maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule
13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act; such disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that material information relating to the Issuer
and its subsidiaries is made known to the Issuer s principal executive officer and principal financial officer by others within those entities; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

(aa) The financial statements (including the related notes) of the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries included in or incorporated by
reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates shown and its results of operations and
cash flows for the periods shown; such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) applied on a consistent basis. The supporting
schedules, if any, present fairly in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP, the information required to be stated therein. Except as included therein, no historical or pro forma financial statements or supporting schedules are required to
be included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus under the Act. All disclosures contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, or incorporated by
reference therein, regarding non-GAAP financial measures (as such term is defined by the rules and regulations of the Commission) comply with Regulation G of the Exchange Act and Item 10 of
Regulation S-K of the Act, to the extent applicable.

 (bb) All tax returns required to be filed by
the Apollo Entities and the Apollo Funds in all jurisdictions have been timely and duly filed, other than those filings being contested in good faith and except where the failure to file would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no tax returns of the Apollo Entities and the Apollo Funds that are currently being audited by state, local or federal taxing authorities or agencies (and with respect to which any Apollo Entity
or any Apollo Fund has received notice), except where the findings of such audit would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. All taxes, including withholding taxes, penalties and interest, assessments, fees and other
charges, due or claimed to be due from such entities, have been paid, other than those being contested in good faith and for which adequate reserves have been provided or those currently payable without penalty or interest or those that would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

 (cc) [Reserved.]

(dd) Except as disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, each of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries
maintains insurance covering its properties, operations, personnel and businesses that insures against such losses and risks as are adequate in accordance with its reasonable business judgment to protect the Issuer and its Subsidiaries and their
businesses, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 9

 (ee) The Issuer is not required to be registered, licensed or qualified as an investment
adviser or a broker-dealer or as a commodity trading advisor, a commodity pool operator or a futures commission merchant or any or all of the foregoing, as applicable; each of the Subsidiaries that is required to be registered, licensed or qualified
as an investment adviser or a broker-dealer or as a commodity trading advisor, a commodity pool operator or a futures commission merchant or any or all of the foregoing, as applicable, is so registered, licensed or qualified in each jurisdiction
where the conduct of its business requires such registration, license or qualification (and such registration, license or qualification is in full force and effect), and is in compliance with all applicable laws requiring any such registration,
licensing or qualification, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or where the failure to be so registered, licensed or qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 (ff) The Issuer is not a party to any investment advisory agreement; each
investment advisory agreement to which any of the Subsidiaries is a party is a valid and legally binding obligation of the Subsidiaries party thereto and in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended
(the Advisers Act ), except such as have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and none of the Subsidiaries is in breach or violation of or in default
under any such agreement which breach, violation, default or invalidity has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(gg) Each of the Apollo Funds that is required to be registered with the Commission as an investment company under the Investment Company Act
(i) is duly registered with the Commission as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, and (ii) is in compliance with Federal Securities Laws (as defined below), except, with respect to each of (i) and (ii), for such
failure to be so registered or to have adopted such programs as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Federal Securities Laws shall mean the Investment Company
Act, the Advisers Act, the Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the rules adopted by the Commission thereunder, as
well as certain applicable provisions under the Bank Secrecy Act and any rules adopted thereunder by the Commission or the Department of the Treasury.

(hh) Consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not constitute an assignment within the meaning of
such term under the Investment Company Act (and the rules and regulations thereunder) or the Advisers Act (and the rules and regulations thereunder) of any of the investment advisory contracts to which any of the Subsidiaries is a party; nor will
consummation of such transactions adversely affect in any material respect the ability of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses in compliance with applicable law as described in the Registration Statement, the
Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, including, but not limited to, providing investment advisory services to clients and funds, whether or not such funds are registered under the Investment Company Act.

 10

 (ii) None of the Apollo Entities or the Apollo Funds, or, to the knowledge of the Apollo
Parties, any director, officer, employee or agent associated with or acting on behalf of any Apollo Entity or the Apollo Funds, has violated or is in violation of any provision of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and the
rules and regulations thereunder or the Bribery Act 2010 of the United Kingdom and the rules and regulations thereunder; or made any unlawful bribe, rebate, payoff, influence payment, kickback or other unlawful payment; and the Issuer has instituted
and maintains policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance therewith. Neither the Apollo Entities nor the Apollo Funds will use, directly or indirectly, the proceeds of the offering in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to
pay, or authorization of the payment or giving of money, or anything else of value, to any person, in each case, in violation of any applicable anti-corruption laws.

(jj) The operations of the Apollo Entities and the Apollo Funds are and have been conducted at all times in compliance with applicable
financial recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, as amended, applicable money laundering statutes of all jurisdictions, the rules and regulations thereunder and any applicable related
or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by any governmental agency (collectively, the Money Laundering Laws ) and no action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or governmental agency,
authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Apollo Entities or the Apollo Funds with respect to the Money Laundering Laws is pending or, to the knowledge of the Apollo Parties, threatened, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

(a) The Issuer, subject to Section 5(c), will comply with the requirements of Rule 430B, and will notify the Representatives immediately,

will promptly advise the Representatives when any document filed under the Exchange Act that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission.

(c) The Issuer will comply with the Act and the Exchange Act so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the Securities as
contemplated in this Agreement and in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus. If at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is (or, but for the exception afforded by Rule 172, would be) required by the
Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters or for the Issuer, to (i) amend the Registration
Statement in order that the Registration Statement will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) amend or
supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus in order that the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as the case may be, will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser or (iii) amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as the case may
be, in order to comply with the requirements of the Act or the

 14

Exchange Act, the Issuer will promptly (A) give the Representatives notice of such event; (B) prepare any amendment or supplement as may be necessary to correct such statement or
omission or to make the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus comply with such requirements and, within a reasonable amount of time prior to any proposed filing or use, furnish the Representatives with copies of any such
amendment or supplement; and (C) file with the Commission any such amendment or supplement; provided that the Issuer shall not file or use any such amendment or supplement to which the Representatives or counsel for the Underwriters shall
object. The Issuer will furnish to the Underwriters such number of copies of such amendment or supplement as the Underwriters may reasonably request. The Issuer has given the Representatives notice of any filings made pursuant to the Exchange Act or
the rules thereunder within 48 hours prior to the Applicable Time; the Issuer will give the Representatives notice of its intention to make any such filing from the Applicable Time to the Closing Date and will furnish the Representatives with copies

except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.

 (e) The Issuer has delivered to each
Underwriter, without charge, as many copies of each Preliminary Prospectus as such Underwriter reasonably requested, and the Issuer hereby consents to the use of such copies for purposes permitted by the Act. The Issuer will furnish to each

supplemented) as such Underwriter may reasonably request. The Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto furnished to the Underwriters will be identical to the electronically transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to
EDGAR, except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.

 (f) The Issuer will timely file such
reports pursuant to the Exchange Act as are necessary in order to make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable an earnings statement for the purposes of, and to provide to the Underwriters the benefits contemplated by, the
last paragraph of Section 11(a) of the Act.

 (g) The Apollo Parties will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the
Securities for sale by the Underwriters under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate (including Japan and certain provinces of Canada) and will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the sale of
the Securities; provided that in no event shall any Apollo Party be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other

 15

than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. The Apollo Parties will promptly advise the Representatives of the receipt by
any Apollo Party of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.

(h) The Apollo Parties will cooperate with the Representatives and use their best efforts to permit the Securities to be eligible for
clearance and settlement through The Depository Trust Company.

 (i) The Apollo Parties will use the net proceeds received by the Issuer
from the sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement in the manner specified in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption Use of Proceeds.

Parties will not, for the period between the Execution Time and continuing to and including the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, otherwise dispose of, or enter into any

Apollo Parties or any person in privity with the Apollo Parties or any Affiliate of the Apollo Parties, directly or indirectly, or announce the offering, of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Apollo Parties (other than the Securities).

 (l) The Issuer, during the period when a Prospectus relating to the Securities is (or, but for the exception afforded by Rule 172, would
be) required to be delivered under the Act, will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act within the time periods required by the Exchange Act.

(m) The Issuer agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, it will not make any offer relating to the
Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a free writing prospectus, or a portion thereof, required to be filed by the Issuer with the Commission or retained by the Issuer
under Rule 433; provided that the Representatives will be deemed to have consented to the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses listed on Schedule II hereto and any road show that is a written communication within the meaning of Rule
433(d)(8)(i) that has been reviewed by the Representatives. The Issuer represents that it has treated or agrees that it will treat each such free writing prospectus consented to, or deemed consented to, by the Representatives as an issuer
free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 433, and that it has complied and will comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 433 with respect thereto, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record
keeping. If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information contained in
the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to

 16

state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Issuer will promptly notify the
Representatives and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.

(n) The Apollo Parties will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to, or that has constituted or that might reasonably be
expected to, cause or result, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, in stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Apollo Parties to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.

(o) The Apollo Parties will, for a period of twelve months following the Execution Time, furnish to the Representatives (i) all reports
or other communications (financial or other) regarding the Issuer generally made available to its security holders, and deliver such reports and communications to the Representatives as soon as they are available, unless such documents are furnished
to, or filed with, the Commission or any securities exchange on which any class of securities of the Issuer is listed and generally made available to the public and (ii) such additional information concerning the business and financial
condition of the Issuer as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request (such statements to be on a consolidated basis to the extent the accounts of the Issuer and its subsidiaries are consolidated in reports furnished to its
security holders).

 (p) [Reserved.]

(q) The Apollo Parties agree to pay the costs and expenses relating to the following matters: (i) the preparation of the 2031 Notes

 17

connection with, the review by FINRA of the terms of the sale of the Securities; (xi) [Reserved]; (xii) the fees and expenses of the Apollo Parties accountants and the fees and expenses of
counsel (including local and special counsel) for the Apollo Parties in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby; (xiii) any fees charged by the rating agencies for the rating of the Securities; and (xiv) all other costs and

(d) The Representatives shall have received on the Closing Date a certificate, dated the Closing Date and signed by an executive officer of
each Apollo Party or its general partner, on behalf of each of the Apollo Parties to the effect that (x) each of the signers of such certificate has carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and
any supplements or amendments thereto, and this Agreement, (y) the

 18

representations and warranties of the Apollo Parties contained in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date and that the Apollo Parties have complied with all of the
agreements and satisfied all of the conditions on their part to be performed or satisfied hereunder on or before the Closing Date, and (z) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the
condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Issuer and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the
Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto), provided that any executive officer signing and delivering such certificate may rely upon his or her knowledge as to

 (e) At the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall have furnished to the

contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto), the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the
Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any
amendment or supplement thereto).

 (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of
the Issuer s debt securities by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization (as defined for purposes of Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any

7. Reimbursement of Expenses. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the
obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Apollo Parties to perform any
agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Apollo Parties, jointly and severally, will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all
properly documented out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed
purchase and sale of the Securities.

 8. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Apollo Parties, jointly and severally, agree to
indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all
losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other U.S. federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities or actions in respect thereof arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including any
information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430B, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged
omission in any Preliminary Prospectus, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or Prospectus of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to
reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the
Apollo Parties will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein, in
reliance upon and in conformity with

 20

written information furnished to the Apollo Parties by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein, it being understood and agreed that the only
such information so furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 8(b) hereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Apollo Parties may otherwise have.

 (b) Each Underwriter severally, and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Apollo Party, each of its directors, each of
its officers, and each person who controls any Apollo Party within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such
Underwriter furnished to the Issuer by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity in clause 8(a) above. This indemnity agreement will be in addition
to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Apollo Parties acknowledge that the statements set forth in (i) the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities in the Preliminary Prospectus and the
Prospectus and (ii) under the heading Underwriting (Conflicts of Interest), the fourth, ninth and tenth paragraphs related to the offering price and concession, stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in
the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriters for inclusion in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any other
written information used by or on behalf of the Apollo Parties in connection with the offer or sale of the Securities, or in any amendment or supplement thereto.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified
party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) will
not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and
(ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to
appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party s choice at the indemnifying party s expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party
shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided,
however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party s election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified
party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party
to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those

 21

available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable
time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior
written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought
hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising
out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to
hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Apollo Parties and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection
with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action) (collectively Losses ) to which the Apollo Parties and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative benefits received by the Apollo Parties on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter be responsible for any amount in
excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Apollo Parties and the
Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Apollo Parties on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the
statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Apollo Parties shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses)
received by them, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Apollo Parties on the one hand or the
Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Apollo Parties and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person
who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee, Affiliate and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who
controls the relevant Apollo Party within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each officer and director of such Apollo Party shall have the same rights to contribution as such Apollo Party, subject in each case to the applicable
terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

 9. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail on the
Closing Date to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the
remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of
Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date; provided, however, that in the event that the
aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, the remaining
Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities to be purchased on the Closing Date, this
Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or any Apollo Party. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding
five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to any Apollo Party or any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

10. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to
the Apollo Parties prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in any securities of the Issuer shall have been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the NYSE or trading in
securities generally on the NYSE shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange; (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by U.S. federal or New York State authorities;
or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis, in each case, the effect of which on financial markets is material
and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (iii), makes it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as
contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).

11. Research Analyst Independence. The Apollo Parties acknowledge that the Underwriters research analysts and research
departments are required to be independent from their respective investment banking divisions and are subject to certain regulations and internal policies, and that such Underwriters research analysts may hold views and make statements or
investment recommendations and/or publish research reports with respect to the Apollo Parties and other Subsidiaries and/or the offering that differ from the views of their respective investment banking divisions. The Apollo Parties hereby waive and
release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Apollo Parties or any other Subsidiary may have against

 23

the Underwriters with respect to any conflict of interest that may arise from the fact that the views expressed by their independent research analysts and research departments may be different
from or inconsistent with the views or advice communicated to any Apollo Party or any other Subsidiary by such Underwriters investment banking divisions. The Apollo Parties acknowledge that each of the Underwriters is a full service
securities firm and as such from time to time, subject to applicable securities laws, may effect transactions for its own account or the account of its customers and hold long or short positions in debt or equity securities of the entities that may
be the subject of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 12. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective
agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Apollo Parties or their respective officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriters or the Apollo Parties or any of the indemnified persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7
and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

 13. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in

state court located in The City of New York and County of New York, and waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding, and irrevocably submits to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any suit, action or proceeding.

19. No Fiduciary Duty. Each of the Apollo Parties hereby acknowledges that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to
this Agreement is an arm s-length commercial transaction between the Apollo Parties, on the one hand, and the Underwriters and any Affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (b) the
Underwriters are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of any of the Apollo Parties and (c) the Apollo Parties engagement of the Underwriters in connection with the offering and the process leading up to the offering is as
independent contractors and not in any other capacity. Furthermore, each of the Apollo Parties agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has
advised or is currently advising any of the Apollo Parties on related or other matters). Each of the Apollo Parties agrees that they will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency,
fiduciary or similar duty to any of the Apollo Parties, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

 20. Waiver
of Tax Confidentiality. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, purchasers of the Securities (and each employee, representative or other agent of a purchaser) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S.
tax treatment and U.S. tax structure of any transaction contemplated herein and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the purchasers of the Securities relating to such U.S. tax treatment and U.S.
tax structure, other than any information for which nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws.

21. Patriot Act. In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L.
107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Apollo Parties, which information
may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the Underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.

such interest and obligation, were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.

day unless the parties to that trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on any date prior to the first business day before delivery will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will
settle in T+2, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their own advisors.

the Indenture dated as of August 12, 2025, among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee (the Existing Indenture , and as amended by the Supplemental Indenture, the 2035 Indenture , and together with the 2031
Indenture, the Indentures , and each, an Indenture ). This letter is being furnished at the request of the Company as contemplated by Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise
defined in this letter have the respective meanings given those terms in the Underwriting Agreement.

 The Company has filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission ) a Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-271275) under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the Act ). The Registration Statement was filed on April 14, 2023 and automatically became effective pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Act. In this letter, the Registration Statement as amended as of the
Applicable Time, including the documents incorporated by reference therein and the information deemed to be part of the Registration Statement under Rule 430B under the Act, is referred to as the Registration Statement ; the base
prospectus dated April 14, 2023 included as part of the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the preliminary prospectus supplement dated November 5, 2025, including the documents incorporated by reference therein immediately prior to
the Applicable Time, is referred to as the Pricing Prospectus ; the Pricing Prospectus, taken together with the information set forth in the term sheet dated November 5, 2025, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant

 A-1-3

 The Commission s website indicates that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement has been issued.

 In connection with the furnishing of this letter, we have examined originals, or copies
certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the following documents:

1.
 the Registration Statement;

2.
 the Pricing Prospectus;

3.
 the Pricing Disclosure Package;

4.
 the Prospectus;

5.
 the Underwriting Agreement;

6.
 the Indentures;

7.
 the Notes of each series;

8.
 the Guarantees (as defined in each Indenture) related to each series of Notes; and

9.
 those documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.

In addition, we have examined: (i) such (a) corporate records of the Company as we have considered appropriate, including a copy of the
amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the amended and restated bylaws of the Company (collectively, the Company Charter Documents ), certified by the Company as in effect on the date hereof, and copies of
resolutions of the board of directors of the Company relating to the issuance of the Notes, certified by the Company; (b) corporate records of the Corporate Guarantor as we have considered appropriate, including a copy of the amended and
restated certificate of incorporation

 A-1-4

and the amended and restated bylaws of the Corporate Guarantor (collectively, the Corporate Guarantor Charter Documents ), certified by the Corporate Guarantor as in effect on
the date hereof, and copies of resolutions of the board of directors of the Corporate Guarantor relating to the issuance of each Guarantee by the Corporate Guarantor, certified by the Corporate Guarantor; and (c) limited partnership records of
each Limited Partnership Guarantor as we have considered appropriate, including a copy of the certificate of limited partnership, as amended, and limited partnership agreement, as amended, of each Limited Partnership Guarantor (collectively, the
 Limited Partnership Guarantor Charter Documents and, together with the Company Charter Documents and the Corporate Guarantor Charter Documents, the Charter Documents ), certified by the general partner of
such Limited Partnership Guarantor as in effect on the date hereof, and copies of resolutions of the general partner of such Limited Partnership Guarantor relating to the issuance of each Guarantee by such Limited Partnership Guarantor, certified by
the general partner of such Limited Partnership Guarantor; and (ii) such other certificates, agreements and documents as we deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions and beliefs expressed below. We have also relied upon oral and
written statements of officers and representatives of the Company and the Guarantors, the factual matters contained in the representations and warranties made in the Underwriting Agreement and upon certificates of public officials and officers of
the Company and the Guarantors.

 In our examination of the documents referred to above, we have assumed, without independent
investigation, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all individuals who have executed any of the documents reviewed by us, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to the originals of all
documents submitted to us as certified, photostatic, reproduced or conformed copies of valid existing agreements or other documents, the authenticity of the latter documents and that the statements regarding matters of fact in the certificates,
records, agreements, instruments and documents that we have examined are accurate and complete.

 A-1-5

 We have also assumed, without independent investigation, that each Indenture constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Trustee and the due authentication of the Notes of each series by the Trustee in the manner described in the certificate of the Trustee delivered to you today.

Based upon the above, and subject to the stated assumptions, exceptions and qualifications, we are of the opinion that:

1. The Company is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has all necessary corporate power
to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement and each Indenture and to own and hold its properties and conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement.

2. The Corporate Guarantor is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Corporate Guarantor has all
necessary corporate power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement and each Indenture and to own and hold its properties and conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement.

3. Each Limited Partnership Guarantor is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each Limited
Partnership Guarantor has all necessary limited partnership power to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement and each Indenture and to own and hold its properties and conduct its business as described in the
Registration Statement.

 A-1-6

 4. The Notes of each series have been duly authorized and executed by the Company. The Notes
of each series, when duly issued and delivered by the Company against payment as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the applicable Indenture and
enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except that the enforceability of the Notes of each series may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). The Notes of each series, when issued and delivered, will conform in
all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption Description of the Notes.

5. Each Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and the Guarantors. Each Indenture constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Company and each Guarantor, enforceable against the Company and each Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except that the enforceability of each Indenture may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law). Each Indenture conforms in all material respects to its description thereof contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption Description of the Notes. Each Indenture has been duly qualified under
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

 6. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
Company and the Guarantors.

 A-1-7

 7. Each of the Guarantors has duly authorized its Guarantees. When Notes of each series are
duly issued and delivered by the Company against payment as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, each applicable Guarantee of each Guarantor will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of each such Guarantor, enforceable against each
such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except that the enforceability of each Guarantee may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). The Guarantees, when the Notes of each series are issued and delivered, will conform in all material
respects to the description thereof contained in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption Description of the Notes.

8. The statements in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the heading Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences, to the extent that they constitute summaries of United States federal law or regulation or legal conclusions, have been reviewed by us and fairly summarize the matters described under that heading in all material respects.

9. The Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as of their respective effective or issue times, appear on their face to be appropriately
responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act, except for the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by
reference in or omitted from either of them, and the Form T-1, as to which we express no opinion; and each document filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ), and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Prospectus (except for financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference in or omitted from either of
them, as to which we express no opinion) appears on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects when so filed to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act.

 A-1-8

 10. The issuance and sale of the Notes by the Company, the issuance of the Guarantees by
Guarantors, the execution and delivery by the Company and the Guarantors of the Underwriting Agreement and each Indenture, and the performance by the Company and the Guarantors of their obligations thereunder will not (i) result in a violation
of the Charter Documents, (ii) breach or result in a default under any agreement, indenture or instrument listed on Schedule II to this letter or (iii) violate the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the GCL ), the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act of the State of Delaware (the Partnership Act ) and those laws, rules and regulations of the United States of
America and the State of New York ( Applicable Law ), in each case which in our experience are normally applicable to the transactions of the type contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement. For purposes of this letter, the term
 Applicable Law does not include federal securities laws (except for purposes of the opinion expressed in paragraph 11 below) or state securities laws, anti-fraud laws, or any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Company,
the Guarantors, either Indenture, the Notes of each series, the Guarantees related thereto, the Underwriting Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to
any party to the Underwriting Agreement or either Indenture or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate. With respect to clause (ii) above, we express no opinion with respect to any provision
of any agreement, indenture or instrument listed on Schedule II to the extent that an opinion with respect to such provision would require making any financial, accounting or mathematical calculation or determination, and in the case of clauses
(ii) and (iii) above, where the breach, default or violation could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 A-1-9

 11. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing, registration or
qualification with, any Governmental Authority, which has not been obtained, taken or made, is required by the Company and the Guarantors, under any Applicable Law for the issuance and sale of the Notes by the Company, the execution and delivery by
the Company and the Guarantors of the Underwriting Agreement and each Indenture and the performance by the Company and the Guarantors of their obligations thereunder other than any filing by the Company with the Commission on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act. For purposes of this letter, the term Governmental Authority means any executive, legislative, judicial, administrative or regulatory body of the State of New York, the
State of Delaware or the United States of America.

 12. Each of the Company and each Guarantor is not, and after giving effect to the
offering and sale of the Notes and the application of their proceeds as described in the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the heading Use of Proceeds, will not be, required to be registered as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder. The opinions expressed above are limited to the laws of the State of New York, the GCL, the Partnership Act and the federal
laws of the United States of America. Our opinions are rendered only with respect to the laws, and the rules, regulations and orders under those laws, that are currently in effect. We express no opinion with respect to the enforceability of any
indemnity against any loss in converting into a specified currency the proceeds or amount of a court judgment in another currency.

 Ladies and Gentlemen:

 We have acted
as counsel to Apollo Global Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company ), and the Guarantors referred to below in connection with the Underwriting Agreement (the Underwriting Agreement ), dated as of
November 5, 2025, among the Underwriters named on Schedule I thereto (the Underwriters ), for whom you are acting as representatives, the guarantors who have signed the Underwriting Agreement (the Guarantors ) and the
Company, relating to the purchase today by the Underwriters of (a) $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company s 4.600% Senior Notes due 2031 (the 2031 Notes ) and (b) $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the
Company s 5.150% Senior Notes due 2035 (the 2035 Notes and, together with the 2031 Notes, the Notes ). This letter is being furnished at the request of the Company in connection with the delivery of our opinion to
you of even date herewith (the Opinion ) under the Underwriting Agreement. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this letter have the respective meanings given those terms in the Underwriting Agreement.

 A-2-2

 The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 Commission ) a Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-271275) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act ). The
Registration Statement was filed on April 14, 2023 and automatically became effective pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Act. In this letter, the Registration Statement as amended as of the Applicable Time, including the documents incorporated
by reference therein and the information deemed to be part of the Registration Statement under Rule 430B under the Act, is referred to as the Registration Statement ; the base prospectus dated April 14, 2023, included as part of
the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the preliminary prospectus supplement dated November 5, 2025, including the documents incorporated by reference therein immediately prior to the Applicable Time, is referred to as the
 Pricing Prospectus ; the Pricing Prospectus, taken together with the information set forth in the term sheet dated November 5, 2025, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433 under the Act, is referred to as the
 Pricing Disclosure Package ; and the base prospectus dated April 14, 2023, included as part of the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the final prospectus supplement dated November 5, 2025, including the documents
incorporated by reference therein, is referred to as the Prospectus.

 The primary purpose of our professional engagement was
not to establish factual matters or financial, accounting or statistical information. In addition, many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of this letter. Furthermore, the limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and in the role of outside counsel are such
that we have not undertaken to independently verify, and cannot and do not assume responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus (other
than as explicitly stated in paragraphs 4, 5, 7 and 8 of the Opinion).

 A-2-3

 In the course of acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the offering of the
Notes, we have participated in conferences and telephone conversations with your representatives, including your counsel, officers and other representatives of the Company and the Guarantors and the independent registered public accountants for the
Company, during which conferences and conversations the contents of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Based upon such participation (and relying as to factual matters on officers,
employees and other representatives of the Company, the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries), our understanding of the U.S. federal securities laws and the experience we have gained in our practice thereunder, we hereby advise you that our
work in connection with this matter did not disclose any information that caused us to believe that (i) at the time it became effective and the Applicable Time, the Registration Statement (except for the financial statements, financial
statement schedules and other financial or accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or from those documents incorporated by reference and the Form T-1, in each case,
as to which we express no such belief), included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) as of the Applicable
Time, the Pricing Disclosure Package (except for the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial or accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or from those documents incorporated
by reference, in each case, as to which we express no such belief) included an

 A-2-4

untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; or (iii) at the time the Prospectus was issued, or at the time of delivery of the Notes on the Closing Date, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (except for the financial statements, financial statement schedules
and other financial or accounting data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or from those documents incorporated by reference, in each case, as to which we express no such belief) included an untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

This letter is furnished by us solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions referred to in the Underwriting Agreement and may
not be circulated to, or relied upon by, any other person without our prior written consent.

Very truly yours,
