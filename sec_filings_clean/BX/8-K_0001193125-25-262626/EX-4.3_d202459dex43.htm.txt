amount) at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, of such United States Treasury security, and rounded to three decimal places.

Commission, copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may from time to time by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Corporation may
