would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 (gg) None of the Corporation, the Subsidiaries, the
Blackstone Funds or, to the knowledge of the Blackstone Parties, any of their respective directors, officers, agents, employees or affiliates, is currently subject to any U.S. sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the
United States Treasury Department ( OFAC ), the European Union or His Majesty s Treasury (collectively, Sanctions ); and the Company and the Corporation will not directly or indirectly use the proceeds of
the offering, or lend, contribute or otherwise make available such proceeds to any Subsidiary, Blackstone Funds or any joint venture partner or other person or entity, for the purpose of financing the activities of any person currently subject to
any Sanctions.

 2. Agreements to Sell and Purchase. The Company hereby agrees to sell to the several Underwriters, and each
Underwriter, upon the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the conditions hereinafter stated, agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the respective principal amounts of Securities set
forth in Schedule I hereto opposite its name at a purchase price of 99.217% and 99.254% for the 2030 Notes and the 2036 Notes, respectively, of the principal amount thereof (the Purchase Price ) plus accrued interest, if
any, from November 3, 2025 to the Closing Date (as defined in Section 4 hereof).

 3. Terms of Offering. You have advised
the Company that the Underwriters will make an offering of the Securities purchased by the Underwriters hereunder as soon as practicable after this Agreement is entered into as set forth in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Final Prospectus.

4. Payment and Delivery. Payment for the Securities shall be made to the Company in federal or other funds immediately available in New
York City against delivery of such Securities for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on November 3, 2025, or at such other time on the same or such other date, not later than five business
days after such date, as shall be designated in writing by you. The time and date of such payment are hereinafter referred to as the Closing Date.

It is understood that each Underwriter has authorized the Representatives, for its account, to accept delivery of, receipt for, and make payment of the
purchase price for, the Notes which it has agreed to purchase. The Representatives may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment of the purchase price for the Notes to be purchased by any Underwriter whose funds have not been received by the
Closing Date, but such payment shall not relieve such Underwriter from its obligations hereunder.

 The Securities shall be in global form,
as specified by the Representatives, and registered in such names and in such denominations as the Representatives shall request in writing not later than one full business day prior to the Closing Date. The Securities shall be delivered to you on
the Closing Date for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters, with any transfer taxes payable in connection with the transfer of the Securities to the Underwriters duly paid, against payment of the Purchase Price therefor plus accrued
interest, if any, to the date of payment and delivery. Delivery of the Securities shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company, unless the Representatives shall otherwise instruct.

 5. Conditions to the Underwriters Obligations. The several obligations of the
Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Blackstone Parties contained herein as of the date hereof and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of
the Blackstone Parties made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Blackstone Parties of their respective obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

 (c) To furnish to you a copy of each
proposed Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to be prepared by or on behalf of, used by, or referred to by the Blackstone Parties and not to use or refer to any proposed Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to which you reasonably object.

 16

 (d) If the Time of Sale Prospectus is being used to solicit offers to buy
the Securities at a time when the Final Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances, not misleading, or if it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare and furnish, at its own expense, to the
Underwriters and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Prospectus so that the statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when
delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.

(e) If, during such period after the date hereof and prior to the date on which all of the Securities shall have been sold by
the Underwriters, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Final Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Final Prospectus is
delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if it is necessary to amend or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters, either amendments or supplements to
the Final Prospectus so that the statements in the Final Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Final Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Final Prospectus, as

 (f) To endeavor to qualify the Securities for offer and sale
under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as you shall reasonably request.

 (g) Whether or not the

Securities by them and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.

 (h) To make generally available
(which may be satisfied by the filing of such statement with the Commission on its EDGAR system) to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than twelve months after the effective date of the Registration Statement, an
earning statement that satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder;

(i) Not to take any action that would result in an Underwriter or the Company being required to file with the Commission

(j) Not to take any action prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act in connection with the distribution of the

 (k) Not to take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that could reasonably

 The Company also agrees

dispose of any debt securities of any of the Blackstone Parties or warrants to purchase debt securities of any of the Blackstone Parties substantially similar to the Securities (other than the sale of the Securities under this Agreement).

 18

 7. Covenants of the Underwriters; Offering Restrictions. Each Underwriter represents
and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, other than (x) the Final Term Sheet and (y) one or more term sheets relating to the Securities containing customary information and conveyed to purchasers
of Securities and that would not constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a free writing prospectus. The Underwriters acknowledge and agree that,
except for information consistent in all material respects with the Final Term Sheet and except as may be set forth in Schedule II or III, the Company has not authorized or approved any issuer information (as defined in Rule 433(h)
under the Securities Act) for use in any free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the Underwriters.

 8. Indemnity and
Contribution.

 (a) The Blackstone Parties, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter
and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the
Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) arising out
of or caused by (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including any information deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430B, or the
omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any
Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission in any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Blackstone
Parties in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.

 (b) Each Underwriter agrees,
severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless each Blackstone Party, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls any Blackstone Party within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Blackstone Parties to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Blackstone Parties in writing by
such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, prepared by or on behalf of, used by, or referred to by the Blackstone Parties, any free written prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto.

 19

 (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall
be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the indemnified party ) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought
(the indemnifying party ) in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the
indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such
proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It
is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, in the case of parties
indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Blackstone Parties, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written
consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this
paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the
aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the
indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement
(x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include an admission of fault by the indemnified party.

(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or
insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable
by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Blackstone Parties on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other
hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in
clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the

 20

Blackstone Parties on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Blackstone Parties on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same
respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by any Blackstone Party and the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate offering price of
the Securities. The relative fault of the Blackstone Parties on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by any Blackstone Party or by the Underwriters and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission. The Underwriters respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.

(e) The Blackstone Parties and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this
Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in
Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in
excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities resold by it in the initial placement of such Securities were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by
reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.

 (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8, the provisions in Section 6(g),
Section 10 (last paragraph) and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Blackstone Parties contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this
Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of any Blackstone Party, its officers or directors or any person
controlling any Blackstone Party and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.

 21

 9. Termination. The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by the
Representatives to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, either of the New York
Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Blackstone Parties shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any
over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States of America shall have occurred,
(iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any
calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery
of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Final Prospectus.

 10.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.

If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to
purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the
aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears
to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such
defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be
increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date any Underwriter or
Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after
such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or of the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the
Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this
paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of any Blackstone
Party to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason any Blackstone Party shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement (which, for the purposes of this Section 10, shall
not include termination by the Underwriters under the items (i), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 9), Blackstone Parties, jointly and severally, will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with
respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in
connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.

 22

 11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written
agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Blackstone Parties and the Underwriters with respect to the
preparation of the Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.

The Blackstone Parties acknowledge that in connection with the offering of the Securities: (i) the Underwriters have acted at arm s
length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Blackstone Parties or any other person and none of the activities of the Underwriters constitutes a recommendation, investment advice or solicitation of any action by the Underwriters
with respect to the Company, (ii) the Underwriters owe the Blackstone Parties only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and
(iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Blackstone Parties. The Blackstone Parties (x) waive to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an
alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities and (y) agree that none of the activities of the Underwriters in connection with the transactions contemplated herein constitutes a recommendation, investment
advice or solicitation of any action by the Underwriters with respect to any entity or natural person. Each of the Blackstone Parties has consulted their own legal, accounting, financial, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent deemed appropriate.

Conflicts of Interest:

Blackstone Securities Partners L.P., as a subsidiary of Blackstone Inc., is deemed to have a conflict of interest within the meaning of Rule 5121 (Public Offerings of Securities with Conflicts of Interest)
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ( Rule 5121 ). Rule 5121 imposes certain requirements on a FINRA member participating in the public offering of securities of an issuer if there is a conflict of interest and/or if
that issuer controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the FINRA member. This offering is being made in compliance with the requirements of Rule 5121. In compliance with Rule 5121, Blackstone Securities Partners L.P. will not sell
any of our securities to a discretionary account unless it has received specific written approval from the account holder in accordance with Rule 5121. The appointment of a qualified independent underwriter is not necessary in
connection with this offering.

*
 Note: A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to
revision or withdrawal at any time.

**
 We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefore on or about the closing date, which
will be on or about the fourth business day following the date of pricing of the notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as T+4 ). Under Rule 15c6-l of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are generally required to
settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes prior to the date that is one business day preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the
fact that the notes initially will settle in T+4, to specify alternate arrangements at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisor.

Blackstone Inc. has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus and related prospectus supplement) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC ) for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus for this offering in that registration statement, and the documents
