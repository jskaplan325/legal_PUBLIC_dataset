 18. Commitments and Contingencies

 Commitments

 Investment Commitments

 Blackstone had $6.4 billion of investment commitments as of December 31, 2024 representing general partner capital funding commitments to the Blackstone Funds, limited partner capital funding to other funds and Blackstone principal investment commitments, including loan commitments. The consolidated Blackstone Funds had signed investment commitments of $127.2 million as of December 31, 2024 which includes $104.0 million of signed investment commitments for portfolio company acquisitions in the process of closing.

 Regulated Entities

 Certain U.S. and non-U.S. entities are subject to various investment adviser and other financial regulatory rules and requirements that may include minimum net capital requirements. These entities have continuously operated in excess of these requirements. This includes a number of U.S. entities that are registered as investment advisers with the SEC.

 These regulatory capital requirements may restrict Blackstone s ability to withdraw capital from its entities. At December 31, 2024, $92.8 million of net assets of consolidated entities may be restricted as to the payment of cash dividends and advances to Blackstone.

 Contingencies

 Guarantees

 Certain of Blackstone s consolidated real estate funds guarantee payments to third parties in connection with the ongoing business activities and/or acquisitions of their Portfolio Companies. There is no direct recourse to Blackstone to fulfill such obligations. To the extent that underlying funds are required to fulfill guarantee obligations, Blackstone s invested capital in such funds is at risk. Total investments at risk in respect of guarantees extended by consolidated real estate funds was $28.4 million as of December 31, 2024.

 The Blackstone Holdings Partnerships provided guarantees to a lending institution for certain loans held by employees either for investment in Blackstone Funds or for members capital contributions to Blackstone Europe LLP. The amount guaranteed as of December 31, 2024 was $91.5 million.

 Strategic Ventures

 In December 2022 and January 2023, Blackstone entered into long-term strategic ventures ( UC strategic ventures ) with the Regents of the University of California ( UC Investments ), an institutional investor that subscribed for $4.5 billion of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. ( BREIT ) Class I shares during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The UC strategic ventures provide a waterfall structure with UC Investments receiving an 11.25% target annualized net return on its $4.5 billion investment in BREIT shares and upside from its investment. This target return, while not guaranteed, is supported by a pledge by Blackstone of $1.1 billion of its holdings in BREIT as of the subscription dates, including any appreciation or dividends received by Blackstone in respect thereof. Pursuant to the UC strategic ventures, Blackstone is entitled to receive an incremental 5% cash payment from UC Investments on any returns received in excess of the target return. An asset or liability is recognized based on fair value with the maximum potential future obligation capped at the fair value of the assets pledged by Blackstone in connection with the above arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the assets pledged was $1.1 billion and the total liability recognized was $938.2 million.

 Litigation

 Blackstone may from time to time be involved in litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of its business. Blackstone s businesses are also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against Blackstone.

 Blackstone accrues a liability for legal proceedings only when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. Although there can be no assurance of the outcome of such legal actions, based on information known by management, Blackstone does not have any unaccrued liability related to any current legal proceeding or claim that would individually or in the aggregate materially affect its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

 In December 2017, eight pension plan members of the Kentucky Retirement System ( KRS ) filed a derivative lawsuit on behalf of KRS in Franklin County Circuit Court in Kentucky (the Mayberry Action ). Plaintiffs alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of Kentucky law in connection with KRS s investment in three hedge funds of funds, including a fund managed by Blackstone Alternative Asset Management L.P. ( BLP ). The suit named more than 30 defendants, including, among others, The Blackstone Group L.P. (now Blackstone Inc.); BLP; Stephen A. Schwarzman, as Chairman and CEO of Blackstone; and J. Tomilson Hill, as then-CEO of BLP (collectively, the Blackstone Defendants ). In July 2020, the Kentucky Supreme Court directed the Circuit Court to dismiss the action for lack of standing.

 In July 2020, the Kentucky Attorney General (the AG ) filed its own action asserting substantially identical claims against largely the same defendants (the July 2020 Action ). In May 2024, the Court denied the Blackstone Defendants and most other defendants motions to dismiss the July 2020 Action. In April 2024, the AG amended its complaint, adding breach-of-contract claims against the fund manager defendants. Defendants moved to dismiss this amended complaint in June 2024. Those motions are pending.

 In August 2022, KRS was ordered to disclose a 2021 report it commissioned to investigate the investment activities underlying the lawsuit. The report did not find any violations of fiduciary duty or illegal activity by [BLP], and quotes communications by KRS staff during the period of the investment recognizing that BLP was exceeding KRS s returns benchmark, providing KRS with far fewer negative months than any liquid market comparable, and that BLP [h]as killed it.

 In January 2021, certain former plaintiffs in the Mayberry Action filed a separate action ( Taylor I ) against the Blackstone Defendants and other defendants in the Mayberry Action, asserting substantially similar allegations as the AG s July 2020 action did, but styled as a direct class action. Taylor I was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky and stayed pending the outcome of the AG s July 2020 action.

 In August 2021, a group of KRS members including those that filed Taylor I filed an action in Franklin County Circuit Court ( Taylor II ) substantially similar to Taylor I, against the Blackstone Defendants, other defendants named in the Mayberry Action, and other KRS officials. The Court denied most defendants motions to dismiss this action in May 2024. Defendants subsequently filed appeals, including a cross-appeal by the Blackstone Defendants, which is currently pending. Additionally, the Blackstone Defendants and the other fund manager defendants filed a petition for a writ of prohibition. On November 12, 2024, the Kentucky Court of Appeals denied defendants writ of prohibition, and defendants subsequently appealed to the Kentucky Supreme Court. Taylor II is stayed pending review of these appeals and cross-appeals.

 In April 2021, the AG filed an action (the Declaratory Judgment Action ) against BLP and the other fund manager defendants from the Mayberry Action in Franklin County Circuit Court, seeking a declaration that certain provisions in the subscription agreements with KRS violate the Kentucky Constitution. In August 2024, the Kentucky Supreme Court granted BLP s motion for discretionary review of the Circuit Court s grant of summary judgment to the AG. The appeal is pending.

 In July 2021, BLP filed a breach-of-contract action against defendants affiliated with KRS, alleging that the Mayberry Action and the Declaratory Judgment Action breach the parties subscription agreements and seeking damages. In February 2024, the Kentucky Supreme Court granted BLP s motion for discretionary review of the Circuit Court s dismissal on ripeness grounds. The appeal is fully briefed and pending.

 On January 3, 2025, we and several other defendants entered into a settlement agreement with KRS and the Commonwealth of Kentucky to, subject to approval by the Franklin County Circuit Court and certain requirements, resolve all claims against these defendants in the AG s actions, resolve BLP s breach-of-contract claims, and bar all claims against the Blackstone Defendants in Taylor I and Taylor II without any admission of wrongdoing. The settlement includes an $82.5 million
cash settlement divided among several defendants, of which our
 portion is expected to be covered by insurance. On January 8, 2025, the settling parties moved for court approval of the settlement. Taylor II plaintiffs objected and requested, in part, that the court refer their matter to mediation. On February 14, 2025, the court ordered the Taylor II parties to conduct a mediation in
 March 2025 and scheduled an approval hearing for the defendants settlement with KRS and the Commonwealth to follow on March 26, 2025. Our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2024 include an accrual for the estimated liability related to this matter.

In October 2022, as part of a sweep of private equity and other investment advisory firms, the SEC sent us a request for information relating to the retention of certain types of electronic business communications, including text messages, that may be required to be preserved under certain SEC rules. In January 2025, we entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC to resolve this matter and paid a civil monetary penalty of $

12
million. During the three months ended December 31, 2024, we updated our accrued liability to reflect the settlement amount, which was less than the amount we previously accrued during 2024.

 Contingent Obligations (Clawback)

 Performance Allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocations received to date with respect to a fund exceeds the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results of that fund. The actual clawback liability, however, generally does not become realized until the end of a fund s life except for certain Blackstone funds, which may have an interim clawback liability. The lives of the funds, including available contemplated extensions, for which a liability for potential clawback obligations has been recorded for financial reporting purposes, are currently anticipated to expire at various points through 2032. Further extensions of such terms may be implemented under given circumstances.

 For financial reporting purposes, when applicable, the general partners record a liability for potential clawback obligations to the limited partners of some of the funds due to changes in the unrealized value of a fund s remaining investments and where the fund s general partner has previously received Performance Allocation distributions with respect to such fund s realized investments.

(a)

 The split of clawback between Blackstone Holdings and Current and Former Personnel is based on the performance of individual investments held by a fund rather than on a fund by fund basis.

(b)

 Total is a component of Due to Affiliates. See Note 17. Related Party Transactions Affiliate Receivables and Payables Due to Affiliates.

 During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Blackstone general partners paid an interim cash clawback obligation of $2.1 million related to a Private Equity segment fund, of which $1.2 million was paid by Blackstone Holdings and $0.9 million by current and former Blackstone personnel.

 For Private Equity, Real Estate, and certain Credit & Insurance Funds, a portion of the Performance Allocations paid to current and former Blackstone personnel is held in segregated accounts in the event of a cash clawback obligation. These segregated accounts are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Blackstone, except to the extent a portion of the assets held in the segregated accounts may be allocated to a consolidated Blackstone fund of hedge funds. At December 31, 2024, $1.1 billion was held in segregated accounts for the purpose of meeting any clawback obligations of current and former personnel if such payments are
required.

 In the Credit & Insurance segment, payment of Performance Allocations to Blackstone by the majority of the stressed/distressed, mezzanine and credit alpha strategies funds are substantially deferred under the terms of the partnership agreements. This deferral mitigates the need to hold funds in segregated accounts in the event of a cash clawback obligation.

If, at

 December 31, 2024, all of the investments held by Blackstone s carry funds were deemed worthless, a possibility that management views as remote, the amount of Performance Allocations subject to potential clawback would be $7.3 billion, on an after-tax basis where applicable, of which Blackstone Holdings is potentially liable for $6.7 billion if current and former Blackstone personnel default on their share of the liability, a possibility that management also views as remote.
