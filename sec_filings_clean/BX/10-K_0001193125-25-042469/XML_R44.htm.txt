(a)

 Represents the Revolving Credit Facility of Blackstone, through Blackstone Holdings Finance Co. L.L.C. Interest on the borrowings is based on an adjusted Secured Overnight Finance Rate ( SOFR ) or alternate base rate, in each case plus a margin, and undrawn commitments bear a commitment fee of 0.06%. The margin above adjusted SOFR used to calculate interest on borrowings was 0.75% plus an additional credit spread adjustment of 0.10% to account for the difference between London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) and SOFR. The

margin is subject to change based on Blackstone s credit rating. Borrowings may also be made in U.K. sterling, euros, Swiss francs, Japanese yen or Canadian dollars, in each case subject to certain
sub-limits.

 The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. Financial covenants consist of a maximum net leverage ratio and a requirement to keep a minimum amount of
fee-earning

 assets under management, each tested quarterly. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Blackstone had outstanding but undrawn letters of credit against the Revolving Credit Facility of $
38.9

million and $
40.3
million, respectively. The amount Blackstone can draw from the Credit Facility is reduced by the undrawn letters of credit, however the Credit Available presented herein is not reduced by the undrawn letters of credit. In February 2025, Blackstone drew $900.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.

(b)

The Issuers have issued long-term borrowings in the form of senior notes (the Notes ). The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuers. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Blackstone, the Guarantors and the Issuers. The guarantees are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Guarantors. Transaction costs related to the issuance of the Notes have been deducted from the Note liability and are being amortized over the life of the Notes. The indentures include covenants, including limitations on the Issuers and the Guarantors ability to, subject to exceptions, incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. The indentures also provide for events of default and further provide that the trustee or the holders of not less than
25
% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. In the case of specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization, the principal amount of the Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes automatically become due and payable. All or a portion of the Notes may be redeemed at the Issuers option in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the Notes. If a change of control repurchase event occurs, the holders of the Notes may require the Issuers to repurchase the Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to
101
% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase.

(c)

Principal on the Secured Borrowings will be paid over the term with repayment amounts dependent on the performance of the underlying assets securing each borrowing. Repayment amounts from the underlying assets are restricted to solely satisfy the Secured Borrowings obligations. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the assets securing both Secured Borrowings equaled $
49.6
million.

(d)

CLO Notes Payable have maturity dates ranging from June 2025 to January 2037. A portion of the borrowing outstanding is comprised of subordinated notes which do not have contractual interest rates but instead pay distributions from the excess cash flows of the CLO vehicles.
