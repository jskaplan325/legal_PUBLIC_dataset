(a)

Amounts presented are inclusive of both legally enforceable master netting agreements and financial instruments received or pledged as collateral. Financial instruments received or pledged as collateral offset derivative counterparty risk exposure, but do not reduce net balance sheet exposure.

 Repurchase Agreements and Freestanding Derivative liabilities are included in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Freestanding Derivative assets are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. See Note 10. Other Assets for the components of Other Assets.

 Notional Pooling Arrangements

 Blackstone has notional cash pooling arrangements with financial institutions for cash management purposes. These arrangements allow for cash withdrawals based upon aggregate cash balances on deposit at the same financial institution. Cash

 withdrawals cannot exceed aggregate cash balances on deposit. The net balance of cash on deposit and overdrafts is used as a basis for calculating net interest expense or income. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate cash balance on deposit relating to the cash pooling arrangements was $981.9 million, which was offset and reported net of the accompanying overdraft of $981.8 million.
