 Segment basis presents revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates the investment funds Blackstone manages and excludes the amortization of intangibles and Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items.

(a)

 This adjustment removes Unrealized Performance Revenues on a segment basis.

(b)

 This adjustment removes Unrealized Principal Investment (Income) Loss on a segment basis.

(c)

 This adjustment removes Interest and Dividend Revenue on a segment basis.

(d)

 This adjustment removes Other Revenue on a segment basis. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Other Revenue on a GAAP basis was $123.7 million, $(92.9) million and $184.6 million and included $122.3 million, $(94.7) million, and $182.9 million of foreign exchange gains (losses), respectively.

(e)

 This adjustment reverses the effect of consolidating Blackstone Funds, which are excluded from Blackstone s segment presentation. This adjustment includes the elimination of Blackstone s interest in these funds, the removal of amounts attributable to the reimbursement of certain expenses by the Blackstone Funds and certain NAV-based
 fee arrangements, which are presented on a gross basis under GAAP but as a reduction of Management and Advisory Fees, Net in the Total Segment measures, and the removal of amounts associated with the ownership of Blackstone consolidated operating partnerships held by non-controlling
 interests.

(f)

 This adjustment removes Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items, which are excluded from Blackstone s segment presentation. Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone s initial public offering and non-recurring gains, losses, or other charges, if any. They consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the Tax Receivable Agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs, gains or losses associated with these corporate actions and non-recurring gains, losses or other charges that affect period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of Blackstone s operational performance. For the year ended December 31, 2024, this adjustment includes removal of an accrual for a
liability for a legal matter.

(k)

 This adjustment removes the amortization of transaction-related intangibles, which are excluded from Blackstone s segment presentation.

(l)

 This adjustment adds an amount equal to an administrative fee collected on a quarterly basis from certain holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. The administrative fee is accounted for as a capital contribution under GAAP, but is reflected as a reduction of Other Operating Expenses in Blackstone s segment presentation.
