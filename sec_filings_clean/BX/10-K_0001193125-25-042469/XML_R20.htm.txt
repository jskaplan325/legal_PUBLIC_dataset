 Equity Securities Subject to Sale Restrictions

 Within Investments of Consolidated Blackstone Funds and Other Investments, Blackstone held equity securities subject to sale restrictions with a fair value of $630.9 million as of December 31, 2024. The nature of such restrictions are contractual or legal in nature and deemed an attribute of the holder rather than the investment. Contractual restrictions include certain phased restrictions on sale or transfer, underwriter lock-ups and sale or transfer restrictions applicable to certain Investments of Consolidated Blackstone Funds pledged as collateral. Restrictions will generally lapse over time or after a predetermined date and the weighted-average remaining duration of such restrictions is 2.2 years. Level III equity securities included in Investments of Consolidated Blackstone Funds are illiquid and privately negotiated in nature and may also be subject to contractual sale or transfer restrictions including those pursuant to their respective governing or similar agreements. Investments within Other Investments subject to restrictions on sale or transfer as a result of pledge arrangements are discussed in Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies Contingencies Strategic Ventures.

Level III Quantitative Inputs and Assumptions

 The following table summarizes the quantitative inputs and assumptions used for items categorized in Level III of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2024. Consistent with presentation in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, this table presents the Level III Investments only of Consolidated Blackstone Funds and therefore does not reflect any other Blackstone

 Rollforward of Level III Financial Assets and Liabilities

 The following tables summarize the changes in financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value for which Blackstone has used Level III inputs to determine fair value and does not include gains or losses that were reported in Level III in prior years or for instruments that were transferred out of Level III prior to the end of the respective reporting period. These tables also exclude financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Total realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded for Level III investments are reported in either Investment Income (Loss) or Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
