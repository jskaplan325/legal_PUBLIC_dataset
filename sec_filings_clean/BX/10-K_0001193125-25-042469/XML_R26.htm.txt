 13. Leases

Blackstone enters into non-cancelable lease and sublease agreements primarily for office space, which expire on various dates through 2043. In addition to contractual rent payments, which are generally subject to escalation provisions, occupancy lease agreements may include payments for certain costs incurred by the landlord, such as building expenses and utilities. To the extent these costs are fixed or determinable, they are included as part of the minimum lease payments used to measure the Operating Lease Liability and are included in Straight-Line Lease Cost. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Blackstone maintained irrevocable standby letters of credit and cash deposits as security for the leases of $14.1 million and $14.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the weighted-average remaining lease term was 8.1 years, and the weighted-average discount rate was 3.4%.
