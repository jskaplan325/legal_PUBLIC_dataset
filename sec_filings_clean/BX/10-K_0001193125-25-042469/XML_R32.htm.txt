Segment Reporting
 19. Segment Reporting

Blackstone conducts its alternative asset management businesses through four segments:

Real Estate Blackstone s Real Estate segment primarily comprises its management of opportunistic real estate funds, Core+ real estate funds, and real estate debt strategies.

Private Equity Blackstone s Private Equity segment includes its management of flagship Corporate Private Equity funds, sector and geographically-focused Corporate Private Equity funds, core private equity funds, an opportunistic investment platform, a secondary funds business and GP Stakes, infrastructure-focused funds, a life sciences investment platform, a growth equity investment platform, an investment platform offering eligible individual investors access to Blackstone s private equity capabilities, a multi-asset investment program for eligible high net worth investors and a capital markets services business.

Credit & Insurance Blackstone s Credit & Insurance segment consists principally of Blackstone Credit & Insurance, which is organized into three overarching strategies: private corporate credit, liquid corporate credit and infrastructure and asset based credit. In addition, the segment includes an insurer-focused platform.

Multi-Asset Investing Multi-Asset Investing is organized into two primary platforms: Absolute Return and Multi-Strategy. In addition, the segment also includes a publicly traded energy infrastructure, renewables and master limited partnership investment platform.

These business segments are differentiated by their various investment strategies. Each of the segments primarily earns its income from management fees and investment returns on assets under management. Blackstone s chief operating decision makers are its Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder
 and its President and Chief Operating Officer.

Segment Distributable Earnings is Blackstone s segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and assess performance across Blackstone s four segments.

Segment Distributable Earnings represents the net realized earnings of Blackstone s segments and is the sum of Fee Related Earnings and Net Realizations for each segment. Blackstone s segments are presented on a basis that deconsolidates Blackstone Funds, eliminates non-controlling ownership interests in Blackstone s consolidated operating partnerships, removes the amortization of intangible assets and removes Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items. Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone s initial public offering and non-recurring gains, losses, or other charges, if any. They consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the tax receivable agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs, gains or losses associated with these corporate actions and non-recurring gains, losses or other charges that affect period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of Blackstone s operational performance.

For segment reporting purposes, Segment Distributable Earnings is presented along with its major components, Fee Related Earnings and Net Realizations. Fee Related Earnings is used to assess Blackstone s ability to generate profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and not subject to future realization events. Net Realizations is the sum of Realized Principal Investment Income and Realized Performance Revenues less Realized Performance Compensation. Performance Allocations and Incentive Fees are presented together and referred to collectively as Performance Revenues or Performance Compensation.

Geographic Information

Blackstone conducts its business primarily in the United States with domestically generated revenues making up 68%, 70% and 77% of total GAAP revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The table below presents the percentage of total GAAP revenues generated by Blackstone by geographic region. Revenues attributed to a geographic region are generally based on the geography of investments held by Blackstone and Blackstone Funds. The geography of an investment is generally the country of domicile for an asset or where a portfolio company is headquartered.

 Segment basis presents revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates the investment funds Blackstone manages and excludes the amortization of intangibles and Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items.

(a)

 This adjustment removes Unrealized Performance Revenues on a segment basis.

(b)

 This adjustment removes Unrealized Principal Investment (Income) Loss on a segment basis.

(c)

 This adjustment removes Interest and Dividend Revenue on a segment basis.

(d)

 This adjustment removes Other Revenue on a segment basis. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Other Revenue on a GAAP basis was $123.7 million, $(92.9) million and $184.6 million and included $122.3 million, $(94.7) million, and $182.9 million of foreign exchange gains (losses), respectively.

(e)

 This adjustment reverses the effect of consolidating Blackstone Funds, which are excluded from Blackstone s segment presentation. This adjustment includes the elimination of Blackstone s interest in these funds, the removal of amounts attributable to the reimbursement of certain expenses by the Blackstone Funds and certain NAV-based
 fee arrangements, which are presented on a gross basis under GAAP but as a reduction of Management and Advisory Fees, Net in the Total Segment measures, and the removal of amounts associated with the ownership of Blackstone consolidated operating partnerships held by non-controlling
 interests.

(f)

 This adjustment removes Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items, which are excluded from Blackstone s segment presentation. Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone s initial public offering and non-recurring gains, losses, or other charges, if any. They consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the Tax Receivable Agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs, gains or losses associated with these corporate actions and non-recurring gains, losses or other charges that affect period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of Blackstone s operational performance. For the year ended December 31, 2024, this adjustment includes removal of an accrual for a
liability for a legal matter.
