(2) To calculate Global Atlantic book value and to make it more comparable with the corresponding metric presented by other publicly traded companies in Global Atlantic s industry, Global Atlantic book value excludes (i) accumulated unrealized (gains) losses on loans carried at fair value, (ii) accumulated other comprehensive income, and (iii) accumulated change in fair value of reinsurance balances and related assets, net of income tax. (3) The purpose of these adjustments is to present these non-GAAP measures without giving effect to the consolidation of the investment vehicles and collateralized financing entities that KKR manages. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures on a supplemental basis to our GAAP results is helpful to equity holders in assessing the overall financial condition of KKR.

36 The leveraged credit composite refers to the composite of certain investment portfolios made in KKR s collateralized loan obligations and U.S. and European leveraged credit strategies including leveraged loans and high-yield bonds. The alternative credit composite refers to the composite of certain investment portfolios made in KKR's private credit strategy, including direct lending (including our business development companies), asset-based finance and junior capital, and in the Strategic Investments Group ("SIG") strategy. Funds and separately managed accounts in liquidation or discontinued strategies are excluded. For a list of our carry paying funds, see the Investment Vehicle Summary on pages 24 to 26. See also Important Information Other Legal Disclosures regarding past performance and investment returns. Note to Page 11 Asset Management Segment Private Equity Except as otherwise noted, amounts referencing the private equity business line, such as AUM, include amounts related to core private equity, including KKR's participation through the Strategic Holdings segment. Notes to Page 16 Insurance Segment Net investment income represents income earned on invested assets, net of investment-related expenses, including investment management fees paid to KKR. Net cost of insurance represents the net cost of funding institutional and individual products interest credited or incurred, benefits incurred, the associated insurance expenses, net of any premiums, fees and other income earned. Notes to Page 18 Strategic Holdings Segment The adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA information represents the measures management currently uses to monitor the operating performance of the businesses. The Capital Invested for Strategic Holdings segment is included in Private Equity Capital Invested within the Asset Management segment and relates to Core Private Equity. LTM Adjusted EBITDA is shown based on the geographic location of the businesses' headquarters. LTM Adjusted Revenue and EBITDA represents KKR s look-through ownership percentage for each of these companies in the aggregate as a result of the firm's investments in these companies through its participation in our core private equity strategy multiplied by the revenue and EBITDA of each portfolio company, respectively. Non-U.S. dollar businesses have been converted at the period-ending foreign exchange rate. A reconciliation of the forecasts for certain non-GAAP measures, including Strategic Holdings Operating Earnings to their corresponding GAAP measures has not been provided due to the unreasonable efforts it would take to provide such a reconciliation. Notes to All Pages All figures in this presentation are as of September 30, 2025, unless otherwise specifically indicated. References to LTM means last twelve months. Note to Page 3 Third Quarter 2025 Segment Earnings The amount of tax benefit from equity-based compensation for 3Q'25 and 3Q'24 was $32.2 million and $35.3 million, respectively, and for 3Q'25 YTD and 3Q'24 YTD was $92.2 million and $90.9 million, respectively. Its inclusion in Adjusted Net Income had the effect of increasing this metric for 3Q'25 and 3Q'24 both by 3%, and for 3Q'25 YTD and 3Q'24 YTD both by 3%, respectively. Note to Page 8 Assets Under Management Perpetual capital refers to a component of AUM that has an indefinite term and for which there is no predetermined requirement to return invested capital to investors upon the realization of investments. Perpetual capital includes the AUM of our registered funds, certain unregistered vehicles, listed companies, and insurance companies, and it excludes our traditional private equity funds, similarly structured investment funds, collateralized loan obligations, hedge fund partnerships and certain other investment vehicles. Investors should not view this component of our AUM as being permanent without exception, because it can be subject to material reductions and even termination. Perpetual capital is subject to material reductions from changes in valuation and withdrawals by or payments to investors, clients and policyholders (including through elections by investors to redeem their fund investments, periodic dividends, and payment obligations under insurance policies and reinsurance agreements) as well as termination by a client of, or failure to renew, its investment management agreement with KKR. Note to Page 9 Additional Capital Detail KKR s portion of Uncalled Commitments to its investment funds and other vehicles includes $10.4 billion across Private Equity, Real Assets and Credit and Liquid Strategies business lines. Notes to Page 10 Fund Investment Performance Traditional private equity portfolio refers to the portfolio of investments held by all of KKR s private equity flagship funds. This portfolio does not include investments from KKR s growth equity or core private equity funds. Opportunistic real estate portfolio refers to the portfolio of investments held by KKR s flagship opportunistic real estate equity funds. This portfolio does not include investments from KKR's core plus real estate funds or real estate credit funds. Infrastructure portfolio refers to the portfolio of investments held by KKR s flagship core plus infrastructure funds. This portfolio does not include investments from KKR s core infrastructure fund, KKR Diversified Core Infrastructure or the Global Climate fund. Important Information Endnotes

Notes to Pages 24 to 26 Investment Vehicle Summary The start date represents the start of the fund's investment period as defined in the fund's governing documents and may or may not be the same as the date upon which management fees begin to accrue. The end date represents the end of the fund's investment period as defined in the fund's governing documents and is generally not the date upon which management fees cease to accrue. For funds that initially charge management fees on the basis of committed capital, the end date is generally the date on or after which the management fees begin to be calculated instead on the basis of invested capital and may, for certain funds, begin to be calculated using a lower rate. This table includes investment vehicles which are not investment funds. The terms investments and investment vehicles are terms used solely for purposes of financial presentation. Notes to Page 27 Strong Financial Profile The Investment amounts do not include KKR's ownership of the Global Atlantic insurance companies through KKR's Insurance segment or KKR's participation in the core private equity strategy through KKR's Strategic Holdings segment. The term investments has been presented solely for purposes of demonstrating the financial performance of certain assets contained on KKR s balance sheet, including majority ownership of subsidiaries that operate KKR s asset management, insurance businesses, broker-dealer and other businesses, including the general partner interests of KKR s investment funds. Traditional private equity includes KKR's traditional private equity funds, co-investments alongside such KKR sponsored private equity funds, and other opportunistic investments. Equity investments in other asset classes, such as growth equity, real estate, infrastructure, energy, leveraged credit and alternative credit appear in these other asset classes. Notes to Page 33 Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures For the three months ended September 30, 2025, Transaction-related and Non- operating items includes (i) $44 million related to transaction-related costs and other corporate actions, and (ii) $24 million of costs associated with certain integration, restructuring, and other non-operating expenses across our Asset Management and Insurance businesses.

38 Important Information Non-GAAP and Other Measures from ANI, because (i) KKR believes that the cost of equity awards granted to employees does not contribute to the earnings potentially available for distributions to its equity holders or reinvestment into its business and (ii) excluding this expense makes KKR s reporting metric more comparable to the corresponding metric presented by other publicly traded companies in KKR s industry, which KKR believes enhances an investor s ability to compare KKR s performance to these other companies. Income Taxes on Adjusted Earnings includes the benefit of tax deductions arising from equity-based compensation, which reduces Income Taxes on Adjusted Earnings during the period. If tax deductions from equity-based compensation were to be excluded from Income Taxes on Adjusted Earnings, KKR s ANI would be lower and KKR s effective tax rate would appear to be higher, even though a lower amount of income taxes would have actually been paid or payable during the period. KKR separately discloses the amount of tax deduction from equity-based compensation for the period reported and the effect of its inclusion in ANI for the period. KKR makes these adjustments when calculating ANI in order to more accurately reflect the net realized earnings that are expected to be or become available for distribution to KKR s equity holders or reinvestment into KKR s business. However, ANI does not represent and is not used to calculate actual dividends under KKR s dividend policy, which is a fixed amount per period, and ANI should not be viewed as a measure of KKR s liquidity. Total Segment Earnings is a performance measure that KKR believes is useful to stockholders as it provides a supplemental measure of our operating performance without taking into account items that KKR does not believe arise from or relate directly to KKR's operations. Total Segment Earnings excludes: (i) equity-based compensation charges, (ii) amortization of acquired intangibles, and (iii) transaction-related and non- operating items, if any. Transaction-related and non-operating items primarily arise from corporate actions, which consist of: (i) impairments, (ii) transaction costs from acquisitions, including any acquisition-related stock consideration, (iii) depreciation on real estate that KKR owns and occupies, (iv) contingent liabilities, net of any recoveries, (v) certain integration, restructuring, and other non-operating expenses, and (vi) other gains or charges that affect period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of KKR's ongoing operational performance. Inter-segment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. These transactions include (i) management fees earned by our Asset Management segment as the investment adviser for Global Atlantic insurance companies, (ii) management and performance fees earned by our Asset Management segment for acquiring and managing the companies included in our Strategic Holdings segment, and (iii) interest income and expense based on lending arrangements where our Asset Management segment borrows from our Insurance segment. All these inter-segment transactions are recorded by each segment based on the applicable governing agreements. Additionally, due to the integrated nature of our segment operations and as part of our strategic capital allocation decisions, intersegment asset transfers have and may continue to occur. In these cases in segment reporting, the assets are transferred at their fair value, and no realization is recognized at the time of transfer. Earnings are recognized upon realization events and transactions with third parties. Total Segment Earnings represents the total segment earnings of KKR s Asset Management, Insurance and Strategic Holdings segments. Non-GAAP and Segment Measures The key non-GAAP and other operating and performance measures that follow are used by management in making operational and resource deployment decisions as well as in assessing the performance of KKR's business. They include certain financial measures that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). These non-GAAP measures, including adjusted net income ( ANI ), total segment earnings, total investing earnings, total operating earnings ( TOE ), fee related earnings ( FRE ), strategic holdings operating earnings, and total asset management segment revenues, are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) among KKR & Co. Inc. and holders of certain securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. and, as such, represent the entire KKR business in total. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of the investment vehicles and collateralized financing entities ( CFEs ) that KKR manages. These measures described above have the definitions given to them below. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures on a supplemental basis to our GAAP results is helpful to stockholders in assessing the overall performance of KKR's business. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-operating adjustments as used in these non- GAAP definitions refers to adjustments made which are not adjustments or exclusions of normal, recurring cash operating expenses necessary for business operations. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, where applicable, are included under the Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures" section of this Appendix. We also caution readers that these non-GAAP measures may differ from the calculations made by other investment managers, and as a result, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other investment managers. Adjusted Net Income is a performance measure of KKR s earnings, which is derived from KKR s reported segment results. ANI is used to assess the performance of KKR s business operations and measures the earnings potentially available for distribution to its equity holders or reinvestment into its business. ANI is equal to Total Segment Earnings less Interest Expense, Net and Other and Income Taxes on Adjusted Earnings. Interest Expense, Net and Other includes (i) interest expense on debt obligations not attributable to any particular segment and (ii) cumulative dividend expense on the Series D Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, net of interest income earned on cash and short-term investments. Income Taxes on Adjusted Earnings represents the (i) amount of income taxes that would be paid assuming that all pre-tax Asset Management and Strategic Holdings segment earnings were allocated to KKR & Co. Inc. and taxed at the same effective rate, which assumes that all securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. were exchanged and (ii) amount of income taxes on Insurance Operating Earnings. Income taxes on Insurance Operating Earnings represent the total current and deferred tax expense or benefit on income before taxes adjusted to eliminate the impact of the tax expense or benefit associated with the non-operating adjustments. Equity based compensation expense is excluded

39 Non-GAAP and Segment Measures (cont d) Asset Management Segment Earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Asset Management segment. This measure is presented before income taxes and is comprised of: (i) Fee Related Earnings, (ii) Realized Performance Income, (iii) Realized Performance Income Compensation, (iv) Realized Investment Income, and (v) Realized Investment Income Compensation. Asset Management Segment Earnings excludes the impact of: (i) unrealized gains (losses) on investments, (ii) unrealized carried interest, and (iii) unrealized carried interest compensation. Management fees earned by KKR as the adviser, manager or sponsor for its investment funds, vehicles and accounts, including its Global Atlantic insurance companies and Strategic Holdings segment, are included in Asset Management Segment Earnings. Insurance Operating Earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Insurance segment. This measure is presented before income taxes and is comprised of: (i) Net Investment Income, (ii) Net Cost of Insurance, and (iii) General, Administrative, and Other Expenses. Insurance Operating Earnings excludes the impact of: (i) investment gains (losses) which include realized gains (losses) related to asset/liability matching investment strategies and unrealized investment gains (losses) and (ii) non-operating changes in policy liabilities and derivatives which includes (a) changes in the fair value of market risk benefits and other policy liabilities measured at fair value and related benefit payments, (b) fees attributed to guaranteed benefits, (c) derivatives used to manage the risks associated with policy liabilities, and (d) losses at contract issuance on payout annuities. Insurance Operating Earnings includes (i) realized gains and losses not related to asset/ liability matching investment strategies and (ii) the investment management costs that are earned by our Asset Management segment as the investment adviser of the Global Atlantic insurance companies. Strategic Holdings Segment Earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Strategic Holdings segment. This measure is presented before income taxes and is comprised of: Dividends, Net and Net Realized Investment Income. Strategic Holdings Segment Earnings excludes the impact of unrealized gains (losses) on investments. Strategic Holdings Segment Earnings includes management fees and performance fee expenses that are earned by the Asset Management segment. Fee Related Earnings is a performance measure used to assess the Asset Management segment s generation of earnings from revenues that are measured and received on a more recurring basis as compared to KKR s investing earnings. KKR believes this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the profitability of our fee generating asset management and capital markets businesses. FRE equals (i) Management Fees, including fees paid by the Insurance and Strategic Holdings segments to the Asset Management segment and fees paid by Ivy vehicles and other Important Information Non-GAAP and Other Measures (cont d) reinsurance vehicles, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net and (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues, less (x) Fee Related Compensation, and (y) Other Operating Expenses. Fee Related Performance Revenues refers to the realized portion of performance fees from certain AUM that has an indefinite term and for which there is no immediate requirement to return invested capital to investors upon the realization of investments. Fee related performance revenues consists of performance fees (i) expected to be received from our investment funds, vehicles and accounts on a recurring basis, and (ii) that are not dependent on a realization event involving investments held by the investment fund, vehicle or account. Fee Related Compensation refers to the compensation expense, excluding equity- based compensation, paid from (i) Management Fees, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net, and (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues. Other Operating Expenses represents the sum of (i) occupancy and related charges and (ii) other operating expenses. Strategic Holdings Operating Earnings is a performance measure used to assess the firm s earnings from companies and businesses reported through its Strategic Holdings segment. Strategic Holdings Operating Earnings currently consists of earnings derived from dividends that the firm receives from businesses acquired through the firm s participation in our core private equity strategy. Strategic Holdings Operating Earnings currently equals dividends less management fees that are earned by our Asset Management segment. This measure is used by management to assess the Strategic Holdings segment s generation of earnings from revenues that are measured and received on a more recurring basis than, and are not dependent on, realizations from investment activities. Total Operating Earnings is a performance measure that represents the sum of (i) FRE, (ii) Insurance Operating Earnings, and (iii) Strategic Holdings Operating Earnings. KKR believes this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the profitability of the most recurring forms of earnings from each of KKR s segments as compared to investing earnings. Total Investing Earnings is a performance measure that represents the sum of (i) Net Realized Performance Income and (ii) Net Realized Investment Income. KKR believes this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the earnings of KKR s segments from the realization of investments.

40 Non-GAAP and Segment Measures (cont d) Total Asset Management Segment Revenues is a performance measure that represents the realized revenues of the Asset Management segment (which excludes unrealized carried interest and unrealized gains (losses) on investments) and is the sum of (i) Management Fees, (ii) Transaction and Monitoring Fees, Net, (iii) Fee Related Performance Revenues, (iv) Realized Performance Income, and (v) Realized Investment Income. Asset Management Segment Revenues excludes Realized Investment Income earned based on the performance of businesses presented in the Strategic Holdings segment. KKR believes that this performance measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into all forms of realized revenues generated by our Asset Management segment. Other Terms and Capital Metrics Adjusted shares represents shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. outstanding under GAAP adjusted to include certain vested securities exchangeable into shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. Adjusted shares excludes the potential dilutive impact of: (i) any conversion of the Series D Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and (ii) unvested shares of common stock and exchangeable securities. Assets Under Management ( AUM ) represent the assets managed (including core private equity), advised or sponsored by KKR from which KKR is entitled to receive management fees or performance income (currently or upon a future event), general partner capital, and assets managed, advised or sponsored by our strategic BDC partnership and the hedge fund and other managers in which KKR holds an ownership interest. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital raising activities of KKR and its hedge fund and other managers and the overall activity in their investment funds and other managed or sponsored capital. KKR calculates the amount of AUM as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of KKR's investment funds and certain co-investment vehicles; (ii) uncalled capital commitments from these funds, including uncalled capital commitments from which KKR is currently not earning management fees or performance income; (iii) the asset value of the Global Atlantic insurance companies; (iv) the par value of outstanding CLOs; (v) KKR's pro rata portion of the AUM of hedge fund and other managers in which KKR holds an ownership interest; (vi) all of the AUM of KKR's strategic BDC partnership; (vii) the acquisition cost of invested assets of certain non-US real estate investment trusts and (viii) the value of other assets managed or sponsored by KKR. The pro rata portion of the AUM of hedge fund and other managers is calculated based on KKR s percentage ownership interest in such entities multiplied by such entity s respective AUM. KKR's definition of AUM (i) is not based on any definition of AUM that may be set forth in the governing documents of the investment funds, vehicles, accounts or other entities whose capital is included in this definition, (ii) includes assets for which KKR does not act as an investment adviser, and (iii) is not calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions. Important Information Non-GAAP and Other Measures (cont d) Capital Invested is the aggregate amount of capital invested by (i) KKR s investment funds (including core private equity) and Global Atlantic insurance companies, (ii) KKR's Principal Activities business line as a co-investment, if any, alongside KKR s investment funds, and (iii) KKR's Principal Activities business line in connection with a syndication transaction conducted by KKR's Capital Markets business line, if any. Capital invested is used as a measure of investment activity at KKR during a given period. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides a measure of capital deployment across KKR s business lines. Capital invested includes investments made using investment financing arrangements like credit facilities, as applicable. Capital invested excludes (i) investments in certain leveraged credit strategies, (ii) capital invested by KKR s Principal Activities business line that is not a co-investment alongside KKR s investment funds, and (iii) capital invested by KKR s Principal Activities business line that is not invested in connection with a syndication transaction by KKR s Capital Markets business line. Capital syndicated by KKR's Capital Markets business line to third parties other than KKR s investment funds or Principal Activities business line is not included in capital invested. Fee Paying AUM ( FPAUM ) represents only the AUM from which KKR is entitled to receive management fees. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which KKR earns management fees. FPAUM is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate management fees and differs from AUM in the following respects: (i) assets and commitments from which KKR is not entitled to receive a management fee are excluded (e.g., assets and commitments with respect to which it is entitled to receive only performance income or is otherwise not currently entitled to receive a management fee) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments. Uncalled Commitments is the aggregate amount of unfunded capital commitments that KKR s investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles (including core private equity) have received from fund investors to contribute capital to fund future investments, and the amount of uncalled commitments is not reduced by capital invested using borrowings under an investment fund s subscription facility until capital is called from our fund investors. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to KKR s investment funds and carry paying co-investment vehicles to make future investments. Uncalled commitments are not reduced for investments completed using fund-level investment financing arrangements or investments we have committed to make but remain unfunded at the reporting date.
