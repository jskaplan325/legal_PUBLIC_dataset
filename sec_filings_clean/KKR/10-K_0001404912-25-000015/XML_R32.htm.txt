Tax Receivable Agreement
KKR Group Co. Inc. (formerly KKR & Co. Inc.) and KKR Holdings were parties to a tax receivable agreement, which required KKR to pay to KKR Holdings or to its limited partners a portion of any cash tax savings realized by KKR resulting from their exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units for shares of common stock. In connection with the Reorganization Mergers, KKR Holdings and KKR terminated the tax receivable agreement on May 30, 2022; provided that, notwithstanding such termination of the tax receivable agreement, all obligations of KKR to make payments arising under the tax receivable agreement with respect to any exchanges completed prior to May 30, 2022 remain outstanding until fully paid.
Prior to the Reorganization Mergers, KKR was required to acquire KKR Group Partnership Units from time to time pursuant to the exchange agreement with KKR Holdings. The KKR Group Partnership made an election under Section 754 of the Code that was effective for each taxable year in which an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units for shares of common stock occurred, which may have resulted in an increase in KKR's tax basis of the assets of KKR Group Partnership at the time of an exchange of KKR Group Partnership Units. Certain of these exchanges were expected to result in an increase in KKR's share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the KKR Group Partnership, primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in KKR's business that would not otherwise have been available. This increase in tax basis may have increased depreciation and amortization deductions for tax purposes and therefore reduced the amount of income tax KKR otherwise would be required to pay. This increase in tax basis may have also decreased gain (or increased loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.
The tax receivable agreement required KKR to pay to KKR Holdings, or to current and former principals who exchanged KKR Holdings Units for shares of common stock (as transferees of KKR Group Partnership Units), 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that KKR realized as a result of the increase in tax basis described above, as well as 85% of the amount of any such savings KKR actually realized as a result of increases in tax basis that arose due to future payments under the agreement. KKR benefited from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that it realized.
These payment obligations are obligations of KKR Group Co. Inc. (formerly KKR & Co. Inc.) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, KKR Group Holdings Corp., which are treated as corporations for U.S. tax purposes, but are not payment obligations of KKR & Co. Inc. or KKR Group Partnership L.P., and are recorded within Due to Affiliates in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition. Payments made under the tax receivable agreement are required to be made within 90 days of the filing of KKR's tax returns, which may result in a timing difference between the tax savings received by KKR and the cash payments made to the exchanging holders of KKR Group Partnership Units.
Effective July 1, 2018, we amended the tax receivable agreement to reflect the conversion of KKR & Co. L.P. to KKR Group Co. Inc. (formerly KKR & Co. Inc.) on July 1, 2018 (the "Conversion"). The amendment also provides that, in the event the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate is increased to a rate higher than 21.0% within the five- year period following the Conversion, for exchanges pursuant to the exchange agreement that take place within that five-year period (other than exchanges following the death of an individual), payments of cash tax savings realized as a result of such exchanges shall be calculated by applying a U.S. federal corporate income tax rate not to exceed 21.0%. The amendment also clarified that the tax benefit payments with respect to exchanges completed at any time prior to the Conversion will be calculated without taking into account the step-up in tax basis in our underlying assets that we generated in 2018 as a result of the Conversion.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, cash payments that have been made under the tax receivable agreement were $27.2 million, $16.3 million, and $10.3 million, respectively. KKR expects to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that they realize. As of December 31, 2024, $18.3 million of cumulative income tax savings have been realized.
Discretionary Investments
Certain of KKR's current and former employees and other qualifying personnel are permitted to invest, and have invested, their own capital in KKR's funds, in side-by-side investments with these funds and the firm, as well as in funds managed by its hedge fund partnerships. Side-by-side investments are made on the same terms and conditions as those acquired by the applicable fund or the firm, except that the side-by-side investments do not subject the investor to management fees or a carried interest. The cash contributed by these individuals aggregated $863.8 million, $629.0 million, and $714.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Aircraft and Other Services
Certain of our senior employees own aircraft that are used for KKR's business in the ordinary course of its operations. The hourly rates that KKR pays for the use of these aircraft are based on current market rates for chartering private aircraft of the same type. KKR incurred $6.2 million, $3.4 million, and $2.9 million for the use of these aircraft for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, of which substantially all was paid to entities controlled by Messrs. Kravis, Roberts and Nuttall, and of which substantially all was borne by KKR rather than its investment funds (which indirectly bear the cost of some of these flights at commercial airline rates).
Facilities
Messrs. Kravis and Roberts, including their estate planning trusts, whose beneficiaries include their children, and certain other senior employees who are not executive officers of KKR, are minority limited partners in a real estate partnership that owns KKR's Menlo Park location. Payments made to this partnership were $7.7 million, $9.5 million, and $8.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. In November 2022, this lease was renewed for another 15-year term.
Other Transactions
In June 2024, certain of our funds contributed equity interests in one portfolio company to another portfolio company in which Mr. Niel indirectly owns a minority equity interest and is a board member. Both of these portfolio companies were, and remain, majority-owned by our funds. In connection with this transaction, the contributing funds received additional equity interests in the acquiring portfolio company, with KKR s equity interest as general partner of the contributing funds representing a value of approximately $22 million. As a result of the transaction, Mr. Niel s equity interest in the acquiring portfolio company, which was and remains less than 5% of its outstanding equity, was diluted on the same basis as other equity holders unaffiliated with KKR. Mr. Niel was not involved in the negotiation of the transaction.
