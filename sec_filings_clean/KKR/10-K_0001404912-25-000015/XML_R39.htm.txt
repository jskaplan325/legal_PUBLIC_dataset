These deferred taxes and associated valuation allowances were reversed in 2022 as a result of a deconsolidation transaction.

(2) In 2022, a valuation allowance was recorded for deferred tax assets related to unrealized tax capital losses that were at the time not considered to be more likely than not to be realized prior to their expiration. In 2024, based on a change in judgment, Global Atlantic concluded that it had the ability to utilize realized capital loss carryforwards prior to their expiration, and to recover its unrealized losses in the available for sale securities portfolio. As a result, Global Atlantic concluded that it was more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets would be wholly realizable, and consequently released the previously recorded valuation allowance recorded against its deferred income tax assets.
(3) On January 2, 2024, Global Atlantic became subject to Bermuda CIT and resulted in the establishment of a $22.1 million deferred tax asset, primarily on available-for-sale securities, which was offset by a full valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2024, a valuation allowance of $36.9 million was recorded on the deferred tax assets associated with Bermuda CIT.
