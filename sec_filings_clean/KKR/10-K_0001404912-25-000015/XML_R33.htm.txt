Segment Reporting [Abstract]

SEGMENT REPORTING
SEGMENT REPORTING KKR operates through three reportable segments which are presented below and reflect how its chief operating decision-makers, who are the Co-Chief Executive Officers, allocate resources and assess performance:
 Asset Management - The asset management business offers a broad range of investment management services to investment funds, vehicles and accounts (including Global Atlantic and the Strategic Holdings segment) and provides capital markets services to portfolio companies and third parties. This reportable segment also reflects how its business lines operate collaboratively with predominantly a single expense pool.
 Insurance - The insurance business is operated by Global Atlantic, which is a leading U.S. retirement and life insurance company that provides a broad suite of protection, legacy and savings products and reinsurance solutions to clients across individual and institutional markets. Global Atlantic primarily generates income by earning a spread between its investment income and the cost of policyholder benefits.
 Strategic Holdings - The strategic holdings business currently represents KKR's participation in its core private equity strategy, which was previously presented in the Asset Management segment s Principal Activities business line. This segment primarily generates income from dividends from these businesses. Dividends are presented net of management fees paid to the Asset Management segment. If KKR were to sell a portion or all of a business reported in Strategic Holdings, the realized gain or loss would be presented as realized investment income, net of a performance fee paid to the Asset Management segment.
KKR s segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and assess performance across KKR s reportable segments is presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) among KKR & Co. Inc. and holders of any exchangeable securities, and the consolidation of the investment funds, vehicles and accounts that KKR advises, manages or sponsors (including CFEs). For each segment, the chief operating decision makers use the key measure of segment earnings to allocate resources to that segment in the annual budget and forecasting process. KKR's segment profitability measure excludes: (i) equity-based compensation charges, (ii) amortization of acquired intangibles, and (iii) transaction-related and non-operating items, if any. Transaction-related and non-operating items arise from corporate actions and non-operating items, which consist of: (i) impairments, (ii) transaction costs from acquisitions, (iii) depreciation on real estate that KKR owns and occupies, (iv) contingent liabilities, net of any recoveries, and (v) other gains or charges that affect period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of KKR's ongoing operational performance. Inter-segment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. These transactions include (i) management fees earned by the Asset Management segment as the investment adviser for Global Atlantic insurance companies, (ii) management and performance fees earned by the Asset Management segment from the Strategic Holdings segment, and (iii) interest income and expense based on lending arrangements where the Asset Management segment borrows from the Insurance segment. All these inter-segment transactions are recorded by each segment based on the applicable governing agreements. Total Segment Earnings represents the total segment earnings of KKR s Asset Management, Insurance, and Strategic Holdings segments:
 Asset Management Segment Earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Asset Management segment. This measure is presented before income taxes and is comprised of: (i) Fee Related Earnings, (ii) Realized Performance Income, (iii) Realized Performance Income Compensation, (iv) Realized Investment Income, and (v) Realized Investment Income Compensation. Asset Management Segment Earnings excludes the impact of: (i) unrealized gains (losses) on investments, (ii) unrealized carried interest, and (iii) unrealized carried interest compensation. Management fees earned by KKR as the adviser, manager or sponsor for its investment funds, vehicles and accounts, including its Global Atlantic insurance companies and Strategic Holdings segment, are included in Asset Management Segment Earnings.
 Insurance Operating Earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Insurance segment. This measure is presented before income taxes and is comprised of: (i) Net Investment Income, (ii) Net Cost of Insurance, and (iii) General, Administrative, and Other Expenses. Insurance Operating Earnings excludes the impact of: (i) investment gains (losses) which include realized gains (losses) related to asset/liability matching investment strategies and unrealized investment gains (losses) and (ii) non-operating changes in policy liabilities and derivatives which includes (a) changes in the fair value of market risk benefits and other policy liabilities measured at fair value and related benefit payments, (b) fees attributed to guaranteed benefits, (c) derivatives used to manage the risks associated with policy liabilities, and (d) losses at contract issuance on payout annuities. Insurance Operating Earnings includes (i) realized gains and losses not related to asset/liability matching investment strategies and (ii) the investment management costs that are earned by our Asset Management segment as the investment adviser of the Global Atlantic insurance companies.
 Strategic Holdings Segment Earnings is the segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and to assess the performance of the Strategic Holdings segment. This measure is presented before income taxes and is comprised of: Dividends, Net and Net Realized Investment Income. Strategic Holdings Segment Earnings excludes the impact of unrealized gains (losses) on investments. Strategic Holdings Segment Earnings includes management fees and performance fee expenses that are earned by the Asset Management segment.
KKR disclosed all the segment expenses under the significant expense principle for each reportable segment. There are no expenses to be disclosed in the other segment category, because segment revenues minus segment expenses equals the segment measure of profit of each reportable segment.
Modification of Segment Information
In connection with the scaling of the core private equity strategy on KKR s balance sheet and the acquisition of the remaining minority equity interests in Global Atlantic on January 2, 2024, KKR reevaluated the manner in which it makes operational and resource deployment decisions and assesses the overall performance of KKR's business. Effective with the first quarter of 2024, KKR changed the preparation of the reports used by KKR's chief operating decision makers. As a result, KKR has modified the presentation of its segment financial information with retrospective application to all prior periods presented.
 The most significant changes between KKR's current segment presentation and its previous segment presentation reported prior to the first quarter of 2024, are as follows:
 Creating a new business segment, Strategic Holdings - The new segment is currently comprised of KKR s participation in its core private equity strategy. Our participation in the core private equity strategy has scaled into a business KKR now evaluates separately from its Asset Management segment. Additionally, KKR may also acquire other long-term assets that are not part of the core private equity strategy for this segment. As of the first quarter of 2024, KKR s participation in its core private equity strategy no longer is reported as part of the Asset Management segment. The Asset Management segment continues to represent KKR's business separate from its insurance operations and continues to reflect how the chief operating decision makers allocate resources and assess performance in the asset management business, which includes operating collaboratively across its business lines, with predominantly a single expense pool. Effective as of the first quarter of 2024, the results of our Strategic Holdings segment includes a management fee and performance fee that is paid to our Asset Management segment for providing advisory services rather than allocating the costs borne by our Asset Management segment to support our Strategic Holdings segment. The historical amounts presented herein do not include any management or performance fees since the governing agreement was not in place prior to the first quarter of 2024.
 Segment Earnings - Segment Earnings is the performance measure for KKR's segment profitability and is used by management in making operational decisions and to assess performance.
