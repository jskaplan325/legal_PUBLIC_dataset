Significant Inputs, Judgments, and Assumptions for DAC and Related Amortization Amounts
Global Atlantic considers surrender rates, mortality rates, and other relevant policy decrements in determining the expected life of the contract. As a part of Global Atlantic's actual experience update for the year ended December 31, 2024, Global Atlantic concluded that there was no material change in relevant inputs, judgments, or assumptions requiring an update of the amortization rate for DAC and related amortization amounts. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Global Atlantic updated mortality and surrender assumptions. These updates reduced the amortization rate for DAC and related amortization amounts by $4.4 million per year.
