(1)In connection with exchanges of KKR Holdings units into common stock of KKR & Co. Inc., KKR records a deferred tax asset associated with an increase in KKR & Co. Inc.'s share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of KKR Group Partnership. This amount is offset by an adjustment to record amounts due to KKR Holdings and principals under the tax receivable agreement, which is included within Due to Affiliates in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The net impact of these adjustments was recorded as an adjustment to equity at the time of the exchanges.
(2)This deferred tax item includes a portion of the tax benefit KKR recognized as a result of the step-up in tax basis generated by the conversion of KKR & Co. L.P. to KKR & Co. Inc.
(3)This deferred tax item includes a portion of the tax liability KKR recognized as a result of the Reorganization Mergers. See Note 1 "Organization" in our financial statements.
(4)In connection with the acquisition of KJRM in 2022, KKR recognized a deferred tax liability resulting from the difference in the book and tax basis of the indefinite lived intangibles.

Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets.
In 2022, changes in market conditions, including rapidly rising interest rates, impacted the unrealized tax gains and losses in the available for sale securities portfolios of Global Atlantic, resulting in deferred tax assets related to net unrealized tax capital losses for which the carryforward period has not yet begun. As such, when assessing recoverability, Global Atlantic considered our ability and intent to hold the underlying securities to recovery. Based on all available evidence, Global Atlantic concluded that a valuation allowance should be established on a portion of the US deferred tax assets related to unrealized tax capital losses that are not more-likely-than-not to be realized, which represents the portion of the portfolio Global Atlantic estimates it would not be able to hold to recovery. In 2024, Global Atlantic concluded that it had the ability to utilize realized capital loss carryforwards prior to their expiration, and to recover its unrealized losses in the available for sale securities portfolio. As a result, Global Atlantic concluded that it was more likely than not that the related US deferred tax assets would be wholly realizable, and consequently released the previously recorded valuation allowance recorded against its deferred income tax assets. Therefore, the valuation allowance of $89 million was released through the income tax expense line of the statement of operations as of December 31, 2024.
On December 27, 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax ("Bermuda CIT"). Commencing on January 1, 2025, the Bermuda CIT generally will impose a 15% corporate income tax on in-scope entities that are residents in Bermuda or have a Bermuda permanent establishment. On January 2, 2024, Global Atlantic became subject to Bermuda CIT and resulted in the establishment of a $22.1 million deferred tax asset, primarily on available-for-sale securities, which was offset by a full valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2024, a valuation allowance of $36.9 million was recorded on the deferred tax assets associated with Bermuda CIT as Global Atlantic does not believe those deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized.
As of December 31, 2024, the Global Atlantic Limited (Delaware) consolidated group has a U.S. federal net operating loss ("NOL") carryforward of $594.8 million; $56.3 million will begin to expire in 2034 and the remainder has an indefinite life. The Global Atlantic Limited (Delaware) consolidated group also has capital loss carryforwards of $402 million which will begin to expire in 2027. In addition, Global Atlantic Re Limited had a federal NOL of $2.6 billion, Global Atlantic Iris Re Limited has a federal NOL of $251.6 million, and the Global Atlantic Iris Non-life entities (Global Atlantic Iris FinCo LLC and Global Atlantic Iris LLC) have a federal NOL of $5.3 million, all of which have an indefinite life.
As of December 31, 2024, KKR has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by certain foreign subsidiaries for which we have not recorded any deferred taxes with respect to outside U.S. federal income tax basis difference on these subsidiaries because of our ability and intent to reinvest such earnings indefinitely unless they can be distributed tax free. KKR will continue to evaluate its capital management plans. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability due to the complexity associated with the hypothetical calculation.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the IRA ) was signed into law. The IRA enacted a new 15% corporate minimum tax ("CAMT") on the "adjusted financial statement income" of certain large corporations, which became effective on January 1, 2023. In addition, the IRA enacted a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases completed after December 31, 2022. KKR does not expect to have a CAMT liability for the year ending December 31, 2024. KKR will continue to review and monitor the issuance of additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury and the IRS.
On December 20, 2021, the OECD released Pillar Two Model Rules, which contemplate a global 15% minimum tax rate. The OECD continues to release additional guidance, including administrative guidance on interpretation and application of Pillar Two, and many countries have passed legislation and others continue to work towards passing legislation to comply with Pillar Two. The changes contemplated by Pillar Two, when enacted by various countries in which we do business, may increase our taxes in such countries. Based on the available legislation, KKR concluded there was no material impact on income taxes with respect to Pillar Two for the year ended December 31, 2024. KKR will continue to evaluate the potential future impacts of Pillar Two and will continue to review and monitor the issuance of additional guidance.
Tax Contingencies
KKR files its tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, KKR is subject to examination by U.S. federal and certain state, local and foreign tax regulators. As of December 31, 2024, tax returns of KKR and its predecessor entities are no longer subject to examinations for years before 2018 for U.S. federal tax returns and 2014 for state and local tax returns under general statute of limitations provisions.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, KKR's unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions, excluding related interest and penalties, consisted of the following:

 For the Years Ended December 31,
 2024 2023 2022
Unrecognized Tax Benefits, beginning of period $ 16,476 $ 41,008 $ 59,633
Gross increases in tax positions in prior periods 10,677 5,169
Gross decreases in tax positions in prior periods (13,878) (8,414)
Gross increases in tax positions in current period 5,927 935 6,261
Lapse of statute of limitations (250) (219) (551)
Settlements with taxing authorities (11,370) (21,090)
Unrecognized Tax Benefits, end of period $ 32,830 $ 16,476 $ 41,008

If the above tax benefits were recognized, the effective income tax rate would be reduced. KKR believes that there could be a decrease to the tax positions up to $15 million within 12 months of the reporting date but the impact of such decrease to the effective tax rate would not be significant.
KKR recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits, KKR had a net increase of accrued penalties of $0.4 million and interest of $1.8 million during 2024 and in total, as of December 31, 2024, recognized a liability for penalties of $2.3 million and interest of $6.9 million. During 2023, penalties decreased by $1.3 million and interest decreased by $6.7 million and in total, as of December 31, 2023, recognized a liability for penalties of $2.0 million and interest of $5.1 million. During 2022, penalties decreased by $2.0 million and interest decreased by $2.0 million and in total, as of December 31, 2022, recognized a liability for penalties of $3.2 million and interest of $11.8 million.
