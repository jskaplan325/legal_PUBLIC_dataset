Insurance [Abstract]

REINSURANCE
REINSURANCEGlobal Atlantic maintains a number of reinsurance treaties with third parties whereby Global Atlantic assumes annuity and life policies on a coinsurance, modified coinsurance or funds withheld basis. Global Atlantic also maintains other reinsurance treaties including the cession of certain annuity, life and health policies.
The effects of all reinsurance agreements on the consolidated statements of financial condition were as follows:

Net Policy Liabilities $ 140,199,242 $ 124,284,313

(1)Reported within reinsurance recoverable within the consolidated statements of financial condition.
A key credit quality indicator is a counterparty s A.M. Best financial strength rating. A.M. Best ratings are an independent opinion of a reinsurer s ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. Global Atlantic mitigates counterparty credit risk by requiring collateral and credit enhancements in various forms including engaging in funds withheld at interest and modified coinsurance transactions. The following shows the amortized cost basis of Global Atlantic s reinsurance recoverable and funds withheld receivable at interest by credit quality indicator and any associated credit enhancements Global Atlantic has obtained to mitigate counterparty credit risk:
