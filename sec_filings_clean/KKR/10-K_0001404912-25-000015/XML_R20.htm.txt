Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Disclosure [Abstract]

DERIVATIVES
DERIVATIVESAsset Management and Strategic Holdings
KKR and certain of its consolidated funds have entered into derivative transactions as part of the overall risk management for their investment strategies. These derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Such contracts may include forward, swap, and option contracts related to foreign currencies and interest rates to manage foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk arising from certain assets and liabilities. All derivatives are recognized in Other Assets or Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities and are presented on a gross basis in the consolidated statements of financial condition and measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. KKR's derivative financial instruments contain credit risk to the extent that its counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. KKR attempts to reduce this risk by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions with strong credit ratings.
Insurance
Global Atlantic holds derivative instruments that are primarily used in its hedge program. Global Atlantic has established a hedge program that seeks to mitigate economic impacts primarily from interest rate and equity price movements, while taking into consideration accounting and capital impacts.
Global Atlantic hedges interest rate and equity market risks associated with its insurance liabilities including fixed-indexed annuities, indexed universal life policies, variable annuity policies, and variable universal life policies, among others. For fixed-indexed annuities and indexed universal life policies, Global Atlantic generally seeks to use static hedges to offset the exposure primarily created by changes in its embedded derivative balances. Global Atlantic generally purchases options which replicate the crediting rate strategies, often in the form of call spreads. Call spreads are the purchase of a call option matched by the sale of a different call option. For variable annuities and variable universal life policies, Global Atlantic generally seeks to dynamically hedge its exposure to changes in the value of the guarantee it provides to policyholders. Doing so requires the active trading of several financial instruments to respond to changes in market conditions. In addition, Global Atlantic enters into inflation swaps to manage inflation risk associated with inflation-indexed preneed policies.
In the context of specific reinsurance transactions in the institutional channel or acquisitions, Global Atlantic may also enter into hedges which are designed to limit short-term market risks to the economic value of the target assets. From time to time, Global Atlantic also enters into hedges designed to mitigate interest rate and credit risk in investment income, interest expense, and fair value of assets and liabilities. In addition, Global Atlantic enters into currency swaps and forwards to manage any foreign exchange rate risks that may arise from investments denominated in foreign currencies.
Global Atlantic attempts to mitigate the risk of loss due to ineffectiveness under these derivative investments through a regular monitoring process which evaluates the program s effectiveness. Global Atlantic monitors its derivative activities by reviewing portfolio activities and risk levels. Global Atlantic also oversees all derivative transactions to ensure that the types of transactions entered into and the results obtained from those transactions are consistent with both Global Atlantic's risk management strategy and its policies and procedures.
The restricted cash which was held in connection with open derivative transactions with exchange brokers was $135.7 million and $133.0 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Global Atlantic also has embedded derivatives related to reinsurance contracts that are accounted for on a modified coinsurance and funds withheld basis. An embedded derivative exists because the arrangement exposes the reinsurer to third-party credit risk. These embedded derivatives are included in funds withheld receivable and payable at interest in the consolidated statements of financial condition.
Credit Risk
Global Atlantic may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives. Generally, the current credit exposure of Global Atlantic s derivatives is limited to the positive fair value of derivatives less any collateral received from the counterparty.
Global Atlantic manages the credit risk on its derivatives by entering into derivative transactions with highly rated financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties and, where feasible, by trading through central clearing counterparties. Global Atlantic further manages its credit risk on derivatives via the use of master netting agreements, which require the daily posting of collateral by the party in a liability position. Counterparty credit exposure and collateral values are monitored regularly and
measured against counterparty exposure limits. The provisions of derivative transactions may allow for the termination and settlement of a transaction if there is a downgrade to Global Atlantic s financial strength ratings below a specified level.

Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges
Where Global Atlantic has derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, these derivative instruments receive hedge accounting.
Fair Value Hedges
Global Atlantic has designated foreign exchange derivative contracts, including forwards and swaps, to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency-denominated bonds in fair value hedges. These foreign currency-denominated bonds are accounted for as AFS fixed maturity securities. Changes in the fair value of the hedged AFS fixed maturity securities due to changes in spot exchange rates are reclassified from AOCI to earnings, which offsets the earnings impact of the spot changes of the foreign exchange derivative contracts, both of which are recognized within investment-related gains (losses). The effectiveness of these hedges is assessed using the spot method. Changes in the fair value of the foreign exchange derivative contracts related to changes in the spot-forward difference are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are deferred in AOCI and recognized in earnings using a systematic and rational method over the life of the foreign exchange derivative contracts. The amortized cost of the AFS fixed maturity securities in qualifying foreign exchange fair value hedges was $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Global Atlantic has designated interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with certain debt and policy liabilities. These fair value hedges generally qualify for the shortcut method of assessing hedge effectiveness. The following table presents the financial statement classification, carrying amount, and cumulative fair value hedging adjustments for qualifying hedged debt and policy liabilities:

 As of December 31, 2024 As of December 31, 2023
 Carrying Amount of Hedged Liabilities Cumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustments Included in the Carrying Amount of Hedged Liabilities(1)
 Carrying Amount of Hedged Liabilities Cumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustments Included in the Carrying Amount of Hedged Liabilities(1)

Debt $ 2,279,261 $ (233,202) $ 1,608,294 $ (165,817)
Policy Liabilities 4,453,766 (204,435) 4,380,048 (255,308)

(1)Includes $193.3 million and $27.8 million of hedging adjustments on discontinued hedging relationships as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Cash Flow Hedges
Global Atlantic has designated bond forwards to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the planned purchase of AFS fixed maturity securities in cash flow hedges. These arrangements are hedging purchases through December 2029 and are expected to affect earnings until 2055. Regression analysis is used to assess the effectiveness of these hedges.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there was a cumulative gain (loss) of $(249.7) million and $(126.9) million, respectively, on the currently designated bond forwards recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to net investment income following the qualifying purchases of AFS securities, as an adjustment to the yield earned over the life of the purchased securities, using the effective interest method.
Global Atlantic has designated interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with floating rate investments, including AFS fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans. Regression analysis is used to assess the effectiveness of these hedges.
As of December 31, 2024, there was a cumulative gain (loss) of $(60.8) million on the currently designated interest rate swaps recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts deferred in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) are reclassified to net investment income in the same period during which the hedged investments affect earnings.
For all cash flow hedges, Global Atlantic estimates that the amount of gains/losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months will not be material.
Net Investment Hedges
Global Atlantic has designated cross currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated equity method investments in net investment hedges. The effectiveness of these hedges is assessed based on changes in spot rates.
Changes in the fair value of the swaps are recognized in other comprehensive income, consistent with the translation adjustment for the hedged investment. The component comprising the difference between forward rates and spot rates is amortized to net investment income over the life of the swaps. As of December 31, 2024, the cumulative foreign currency translation gain (loss) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income related to net investment hedges was $(25.3) million.
