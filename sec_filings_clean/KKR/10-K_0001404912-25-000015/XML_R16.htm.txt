NET GAINS (LOSSES) FROM INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES - ASSET MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGIC HOLDINGS
NET GAINS (LOSSES) FROM INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES - ASSET MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGIC HOLDINGSNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities in the consolidated statements of operations consist primarily of the realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments (including foreign exchange gains and losses attributable to foreign denominated investments and related activities) and other financial instruments, including those for which the fair value option has been elected. Unrealized gains or losses result from changes in the fair value of these investments and other financial instruments during a period. Upon disposition of an investment or financial instrument, previously recognized unrealized gains or losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period.
The following table summarizes total Net Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities:
