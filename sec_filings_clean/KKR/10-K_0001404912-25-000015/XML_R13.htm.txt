Organization, Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]

ORGANIZATION
ORGANIZATIONKKR & Co. Inc. (NYSE: KKR), through its subsidiaries (collectively, "KKR"), is a leading global investment firm that offers alternative asset management as well as capital markets and insurance solutions. KKR aims to generate attractive investment returns by following a patient and disciplined investment approach, employing world-class people, and supporting growth in its portfolio companies and communities. KKR sponsors investment funds that invest in private equity, credit, and real assets and has strategic partners that manage hedge funds. KKR s insurance subsidiaries offer retirement, life, and reinsurance products under the management of The Global Atlantic Financial Group LLC ("TGAFG" and, together with its insurance companies and other subsidiaries, "Global Atlantic").
KKR & Co. Inc. is the parent company of KKR Group Co. Inc., which in turn owns KKR Group Holdings Corp., which is the general partner of KKR Group Partnership L.P. ("KKR Group Partnership"). KKR & Co. Inc. both indirectly controls KKR Group Partnership and indirectly holds Class A partner interests in KKR Group Partnership ("KKR Group Partnership Units") representing economic interests in KKR's business. As of December 31, 2024, KKR & Co. Inc. held indirectly approximately 99.2% of the KKR Group Partnership Units. The remaining balance is held indirectly by KKR current and former employees through restricted holdings units representing an ownership interest in KKR Group Partnership Units, which may be exchanged for shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. ("exchangeable securities"). As limited partner interests, these KKR Group Partnership Units are non-voting and do not entitle anyone other than KKR to manage its business and affairs. KKR Group Partnership also has outstanding limited partner interests that provide for a carry pool provided by KKR Associates Holdings L.P. ("Associates Holdings").
On January 2, 2024, KKR acquired the remaining minority interests of Global Atlantic held by third party co-investors and Global Atlantic employees in exchange for cash and securities exchangeable for shares of KKR & Co. Inc. common stock (the 2024 GA Acquisition ). The purchase price paid by KKR was approximately $2.6 billion in cash and $41 million in securities exchangeable for shares of KKR & Co. Inc. common stock. Global Atlantic was consolidated prior to January 2, 2024 and consequently, this transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction. At the time of the 2024 GA Acquisition, the carrying value of the noncontrolling interests held by third party co-investors and Global Atlantic employees in Global Atlantic was lower than the purchase price paid by KKR, which was determined by excluding unrealized losses on its available-for-sale portfolio and consistent with the calculation of the purchase price paid by KKR to acquire Global Atlantic in 2021. As such, this transaction resulted in a decrease in KKR & Co. Inc. Stockholders Equity.
In this report, references to "KKR," refer to KKR & Co. Inc. and its subsidiaries, including The Global Atlantic Financial Group LLC ("TGAFG" and, together with its insurance companies and other subsidiaries, "Global Atlantic"), unless the context requires otherwise, especially in sections where "KKR" is intended to refer to the asset management and strategic holdings businesses only. References in these financial statements to "principals" are to KKR's current and former employees who held interests in KKR's business through KKR Holdings prior to the Reorganization Mergers (as defined below). References to our "funds," "vehicles" or "investment vehicles" refer to a wide array of investment funds, vehicles, and accounts that are advised, managed or sponsored by one or more subsidiaries of KKR, including collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs") and business development companies (each, a "BDC"), unless the context requires otherwise.
Reorganization Agreement
On October 8, 2021, KKR entered into a Reorganization Agreement (the "Reorganization Agreement") with KKR Holdings L.P. ("KKR Holdings"), KKR Management LLP (which holds the sole outstanding share of Series I preferred stock), Associates Holdings, and the other parties thereto. Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, the parties agreed to undertake a series of integrated transactions to effect a number of transformative structural and governance changes, some of which were completed on May 31, 2022, and other changes to be completed in the future. On May 31, 2022, KKR completed the merger transactions ("Reorganization Mergers") contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement pursuant to which KKR acquired KKR Holdings (which changed its name to KKR Group Holdings L.P.) and all of the KKR Group Partnership Units held by it.
Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, the following transactions will occur in the future on the Sunset Date (as defined below):
i.the control of KKR & Co. Inc. by KKR Management LLP and the Series I Preferred Stock held by it will be eliminated,
ii.the voting rights for all common stock of KKR & Co. Inc., including with respect to the election of directors, will be established on a one vote per share basis, and
iii.KKR will acquire control of Associates Holdings, the entity providing for the allocation of carry proceeds to KKR employees, also known as the carry pool.
The Sunset Date will be the earlier of (i) December 31, 2026 and (ii) the six-month anniversary of the first date on which the death or permanent disability of both Mr. Henry Kravis and Mr. George Roberts (collectively, "Co-Founders") has occurred (or any earlier date consented to by KKR Management LLP in its sole discretion). In addition, KKR Management LLP agreed not to transfer its ownership of the sole share of Series I Preferred Stock, and, the changes to occur effective on the Sunset Date are unconditional commitments of the parties to the Reorganization Agreement.
