(1)Payout annuities generally only have a single premium received at contract inception. As a result, the liability for future policy benefits generally would not reflect a present value for future premiums for payout annuities.
(2) Other consists of activity related to long-term care insurance, variable annuities, traditional life insurance, preneed insurance, and fixed-rate annuity products. Mortality and morbidity risks associated with the long-term care insurance have been ceded to a third-party reinsurer.
(3)Reinsurance recoverables associated with the liability for future policy benefits is net of the effect of changes in discount rate assumptions of $(284.7) million and $389.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Significant Inputs, Judgments, and Assumptions used in Measuring Future Policyholder Benefits
Significant policyholder behavior and other assumption inputs to the calculation of the liability for future policy benefits include discount rates, mortality and, for life insurance, lapse rates. Global Atlantic reviews its assumptions at least annually, and more frequently if necessary. Accordingly, as part of the annual assumption review conducted during the year ended December 31, 2024, mortality assumptions were revised for payout annuities, which resulted in a $28.4 million increase to net income before taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2023, premium and lapse assumptions were revised for traditional life insurance products (included with the Other category), which resulted in a $4.2 million increase to net income before taxes.
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Global Atlantic recognized $238.1 million and $(315.0) million in other comprehensive income (loss) (gross of the impact of reinsurance), respectively, due to changes in the future policy benefits estimate from updating discount rates. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no changes to the methods used to determine the discount rates.

Weighted-Average Interest, Current Discount Rate 3.29 % 3.09 %

Significant Inputs, Judgments, and Assumptions used in Measuring the Additional Liabilities for Annuitization, Death, or Other Insurance Benefits
Significant policyholder behavior assumption inputs to the calculation of the additional liability for annuitization, death, or other insurance benefits include mortality, lapse rates, investment yields and interest margin. Global Atlantic reviews its assumptions at least annually, and more frequently if necessary. Accordingly, as part of the annual assumption review conducted during the year ended December 31, 2024, assumptions for lapse rates, investment yields, and interest margin were updated, which resulted in a $16.4 million decrease to net income before taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2023, assumptions for lapse rates, investment yields, and option budget costs were updated, which resulted in a $13.8 million increase to net income before taxes.

The following reflects the reconciliation of the market risk benefits reflected in the preceding table to the amounts reported in an asset and liability position, respectively, in the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:

 As of December 31, 2024 As of December 31, 2023
 Asset Liability Net Asset Liability Net
Fixed-Indexed Annuities $ 2,319 $ 818,300 $ (815,981) $ $ 868,268 $ (868,268)
Variable- and Other Annuities 183,936 (183,936) 17 252,700 (252,683)
Total $ 2,319 $ 1,002,236 $ (999,917) $ 17 $ 1,120,968 $ (1,120,951)

Significant Inputs, Judgments, and Assumptions used in Measuring Market Risk Benefits
Significant policyholder behavior and other assumption inputs to the calculation of the market risk benefits include interest rates, instrument-specific credit risk, mortality rates, surrender rates, and utilization rates. Global Atlantic reviews its assumptions at least annually, and more frequently if necessary. Accordingly, as part of the annual assumption review conducted during the year ended December 31, 2024, assumptions for fixed-indexed annuities mortality, surrenders, and utilization, and variable annuity activations were updated, which resulted in a $128.7 million increase to net income before taxes.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, assumptions for fixed-indexed annuity surrender and partial withdrawals, and variable annuity surrender and activations were updated, which resulted in a $37.6 million increase to net income before taxes.
Separate Account Liabilities
Separate account assets and liabilities consist of investment accounts established and maintained by Global Atlantic for certain variable annuity and interest-sensitive life insurance contracts. Some of these contracts include minimum guarantees such as GMDBs and GMWBs that guarantee a minimum payment to the policyholder.
The assets that support these variable annuity and interest-sensitive life insurance contracts are measured at fair value and are reported as separate account assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. An equivalent amount is reported as separate account liabilities. Market risk benefit assets and liabilities for minimum guarantees are valued and presented separately from separate account assets and separate account liabilities. For more information on market risk benefits see Market risk benefits in this footnote. Policy charges assessed against the policyholders for mortality, administration and other services are included in Policy fees in the consolidated statements of operations.
The following table presents the balances of and changes in separate account liabilities:

 December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023

Balance as of Beginning of Period $ 3,565,029 $ 541,971 $ 4,107,000 $ 3,627,770 $ 503,024 $ 4,130,794

(1)Cash surrender value attributed to the separate accounts does not reflect the impact of surrender charges; surrender charges are attributed to policyholder account balances recorded in the general account.

The closed blocks of business represent policies acquired through acquisition, which were valued at fair value as of the acquisition date.
