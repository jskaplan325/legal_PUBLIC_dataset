Equity [Abstract]

EQUITY
EQUITYStockholders' Equity
Common Stock
The common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. is entitled to vote as provided by its certificate of incorporation, Delaware General Corporation Law and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). Subject to preferences that apply to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time on which dividends are payable, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available if the Board of Directors, in its discretion, determines to declare dividends and then only at the times and in the amounts that the Board of Directors may determine. The common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights and is not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions.
Series I Preferred Stock
Except for any distribution required by Delaware law to be made upon a dissolution event, the holders of Series I preferred stock do not have any economic rights to receive dividends. Series I preferred stock is entitled to vote on various matters that may be submitted to vote of the stockholders and the other matters as set forth in the certificate of incorporation. Upon a dissolution event, each holder of Series I preferred stock will be entitled to a payment equal to $0.01 per share of Series I preferred stock. The Series I preferred stock will be eliminated on the Sunset Date (as defined in Note 1 "Organization"), which is scheduled to occur not later than December 31, 2026.
Share Repurchase Program
Under KKR's repurchase program, shares of common stock of KKR & Co. Inc. may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined by KKR in its discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. In addition to the repurchases of common stock, the repurchase program will be used for the retirement (by cash settlement or the payment of tax withholding amounts upon net settlement) of equity awards granted pursuant to our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan representing the right to receive common stock. KKR expects that the program will be in effect until the maximum approved dollar amount has been used. The program does not require KKR to repurchase or retire any specific number of shares of common stock or equity awards, respectively, and the program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. As of January 31, 2025, there was approximately $69 million remaining under the program. In April 2024, the share repurchase program was amended such that when the remaining available amount under the share repurchase program becomes $50 million or less, the total available amount under the share repurchase program will automatically add an additional $500 million to the then remaining available amount of $50 million or less. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.
The following table presents the shares of KKR & Co. Inc. common stock that have been repurchased or equity awards retired under the repurchase program:

 For the Years Ended December 31,
 2024 2023 2022
Shares of common stock repurchased 5,395,162 5,191,174
Equity awards for common stock retired 1,170,857 764,999 1,308,501

Change in KKR & Co. Inc.'s Ownership Interest
Vesting of restricted holdings units results in a change in ownership in KKR Group Partnership, while KKR retains a controlling interest, and is accounted for as an equity transaction between the controlling and noncontrolling interests.
Noncontrolling Interests

(i)third party fund investors in KKR's consolidated funds and certain other entities;
(ii)third parties in KKR's Capital Markets business line;
(iii)certain current and former employees who hold exchangeable securities; and
