(1)For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock calculated under the if-converted method was dilutive, and as such (i) shares of common stock (assuming a conversion ratio based on the average volume weighted average price per share of common stock over each reporting period) were included in the Weighted Average Shares of Common Stock Outstanding - Diluted and (ii) Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred dividends were added back to Net Income (Loss) Available to KKR & Co. Inc. Common Stockholders - Diluted.
(2)For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 Weighted Average Shares of Common Stock Outstanding Diluted includes unvested equity awards, including certain equity awards that have met their market price-based vesting condition but have not satisfied their service-based vesting condition. Vesting of these equity awards dilute equity holders of KKR Group Partnership, including KKR & Co. Inc. and holders of exchangeable securities pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests in KKR Group Partnership. For the year ended December 31, 2022, all unvested equity awards are excluded from the calculation of Diluted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to KKR & Co. Inc. Per Share of Common Stock because inclusion of such unvested equity awards would be anti-dilutive having the effect of decreasing the loss per share of common stock.
