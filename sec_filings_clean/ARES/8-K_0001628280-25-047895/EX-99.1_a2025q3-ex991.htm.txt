ARES MANAGEMENT CORPORATION REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2025 RESULTS

NEW YORK--Ares Management Corporation (NYSE ARES) today reported its financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2025.

GAAP net income attributable to Ares Management Corporation was $288.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025. On a basic and diluted basis, net income attributable to Ares Management Corporation per share of Class A and non-voting common stock was $1.15 for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

After-tax realized income was $425.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $1.19 for the quarter ended September 30, 2025. Fee related earnings were $471.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

 We reported an outstanding third quarter, highlighted by strong financial results, quality fund performance, improving credit quality, a record quarter of fundraising and increased investment activity across the platform, said Michael Arougheti, Chief Executive Officer of Ares. We now expect to meaningfully exceed our previous annual fundraising record of $93 billion this year, driven by the growing breadth of investor demand across our various investment strategies and distribution channels.

 Our strong fundraising and investing activities supported a 28% year-over-year increase in AUM, FPAUM and management fees in the third quarter, said Jarrod Phillips, Chief Financial Officer of Ares. Based upon an improving tone in our markets and a healthy investment pipeline, we are well positioned to generate future earnings growth as we deploy our significant available capital, which stood at $150 billion at the end of the third quarter.
