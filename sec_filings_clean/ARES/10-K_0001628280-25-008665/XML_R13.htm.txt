Fair Value Disclosures [Abstract]

FAIR VALUE
5. FAIR VALUE
Financial Instrument Valuations
The valuation techniques used by the Company to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The valuation techniques applied to investments held by the Company and by the Consolidated Funds vary depending on the nature of the investment.
CLOs and CLO loan obligations: The fair value of CLOs held by the Company are estimated based on either a third-party pricing service or broker quote and are classified as Level III. The Company measures its CLO loan obligations of the Consolidated Funds by first determining whether the fair values of the financial assets or financial liabilities of its Consolidated CLOs are more observable.
Contingent consideration: The Company generally determines the fair value of its contingent consideration liabilities by using a probability weighted expected return method, including the Monte Carlo simulation model. These models consider a range of assumptions including historical experience, prior period performance, current progress towards targets, probability-weighted scenarios, and management s own assumptions. The discount rate used is determined based on the weighted average cost of capital for the Company. Once the associated targets are achieved, the contingent consideration is reported at the
settlement amount. The fair value of the Company s contingent consideration liabilities are classified as Level III. Liabilities recorded in connection with the Company s contingent consideration are included within accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and the associated changes in fair value are included within other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Corporate debt, bonds, bank loans, securitization vehicles and derivative instruments: The fair value of corporate debt, bonds, bank loans, securitization vehicles and derivative instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices, dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs. These investments are generally classified as Level II. The Company obtains prices from independent pricing services that generally utilize broker quotes and may use various other pricing techniques, which take into account appropriate factors such as yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other data. If management is only able to obtain a single broker quote, or utilizes a pricing model, such securities will generally be classified as Level III.
Equity and equity-related securities: Securities traded on a national securities exchange are stated at the last reported sales price on the day of valuation. To the extent these securities are actively traded and valuation adjustments are not applied, they are classified as Level I. Securities that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices, dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs obtained by the Company from independent pricing services are classified as Level II. Securities that have market prices that are not readily available, utilize valuation models of third-party pricing service or internal models using unobservable inputs to determine the fair value are classified as Level III.
Money market funds and U.S. treasury securities: The fair value of money market funds that invest in treasury-backed securities and U.S. treasury securities is estimated using quoted market prices in active markets. These investments are classified as Level I.
Partnership interests: The Company generally values its investments using the NAV per share equivalent calculated by the investment manager as a practical expedient to determining an independent fair value or estimates based on various valuation models of third-party pricing services, as well as internal models. The Company does not categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments where fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient.
In limited circumstances, the Company may determine, based on its own due diligence and investment procedures, that NAV per share does not represent fair value. In such circumstances, the Company will estimate the fair value in good faith and in a manner that it reasonably chooses. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, NAV per share represents the fair value of the Company s investments in partnership interests.

The substantial majority of the Company s private commingled funds are closed-ended, and accordingly, do not permit investors to redeem their interests other than in limited circumstances that are beyond the control of the Company, such as instances in which retaining the interest could cause the investor to violate a law, regulation or rule. The Company also has open-ended and evergreen funds where investors have the right to withdraw their capital, subject to the terms of the respective constituent documents, over periods generally ranging from one month to three years. In addition, the Company has minority investments in vehicles that may only have a single other investor that may allow such investors to terminate the fund pursuant to the terms of the applicable constituent documents of such vehicle.

Transfers out of Level III were generally attributable to certain investments that experienced a more significant level of market activity during the period and thus were valued using observable inputs either from independent pricing services or multiple brokers. Transfers into Level III were generally attributable to certain investments that experienced a less significant level of market activity during the period and thus were only able to obtain one or fewer quotes from a broker or independent pricing service.

The Consolidated Funds have limited partnership interests in private equity funds managed by the Company that are valued using NAV per share. The terms and conditions of these funds do not allow for redemptions without certain events or approvals that are outside the Company s control.

The following table summarizes the investments held at fair value and unfunded commitments of the Consolidated Funds interests valued using NAV per share:
