Organization, Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Statements [Abstract]

ORGANIZATION
1. ORGANIZATION
Ares Management Corporation (the Company ), a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global alternative investment manager operating integrated groups across Credit, Real Assets, Private Equity and Secondaries. Information about segments should be read together with Note 14. Segment Reporting. Subsidiaries of the Company serve as the general partners and/or investment managers to various funds and managed accounts within each investment group (the Ares Funds ). These subsidiaries provide investment advisory services to the Ares Funds in exchange for management fees.

The accompanying audited financial statements include the consolidated results of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company is a holding company that operates and controls all of the businesses and affairs of and conducts all of its material business activities through Ares Holdings L.P. ( Ares Holdings ). Ares Holdings represents all the activities of the Ares Operating Group or AOG and may be referred to interchangeably. The Company, indirectly through its wholly owned subsidiary, Ares Holdco LLC, is the general partner of the Ares Operating Group entity.

The Company manages or controls certain entities that have been consolidated in the accompanying financial statements as described in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. These entities include Ares funds, co-investment vehicles, collateralized loan obligations or funds (collectively CLOs ) and special purpose acquisition companies ( SPACs ) (collectively, the Consolidated Funds ).

Including the results of the Consolidated Funds significantly increases the reported amounts of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows within the accompanying consolidated financial statements. However, the Consolidated Funds results included herein have no direct effect on the net income attributable to Ares Management Corporation or to its stockholders equity, except where accounting for a redemption or liquidation preference requires the reallocation of ownership based on specific terms of a profit sharing agreement. Instead, economic ownership interests of the investors in the Consolidated Funds are reflected as redeemable and non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds. Further, cash flows allocable to redeemable and non-controlling interest in Consolidated Funds are specifically identifiable within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
