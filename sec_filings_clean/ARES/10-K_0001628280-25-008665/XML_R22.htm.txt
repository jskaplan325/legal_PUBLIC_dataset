Segment Reporting [Abstract]

SEGMENT REPORTING
14. SEGMENT REPORTING

The Company operates through its distinct operating segments. On January 1, 2024, the Company changed its segment composition. The special opportunities strategy, historically part of the Private Equity Group, is now referred to as opportunistic credit and is presented within the Credit Group. The Company has modified historical results to conform with its current presentation. The Company operating segments are summarized below:

Credit Group: The Credit Group manages credit strategies across the liquid and illiquid spectrum, including liquid credit, alternative credit, opportunistic credit, direct lending and Asia-Pacific ( APAC ) credit.

Real Assets Group: The Real Assets Group manages comprehensive equity and debt strategies across real estate and infrastructure investments.

Private Equity Group: The Private Equity Group broadly categorizes its investment strategies as corporate private equity and APAC private equity.

Secondaries Group: The Secondaries Group invests in secondary markets across a range of alternative asset class strategies, including private equity, real estate, infrastructure and credit.

Other: Other represents a compilation of operating segments and strategic investments that seek to expand the Company s reach and its scale in new and existing global markets but individually do not meet reporting thresholds. These results include activities from: (i) Ares Insurance Solutions ( AIS ), the Company s insurance platform that provides solutions to insurance clients including asset management, capital solutions and corporate development; (ii) the SPACs sponsored by the Company; and (iii) a venture capital business with fund strategies that are focused on applied artificial intelligence, among others.
The Operations Management Group (the OMG ) consists of shared resource groups to support the Company s operating segments by providing infrastructure and administrative support in the areas of accounting/finance, operations, information technology, legal, compliance, human resources, strategy, relationship management, and distribution, including Ares Wealth Management Solutions, LLC ( AWMS ). AWMS facilitates the product development, distribution, marketing and client management activities for investment offerings in the global wealth management channel. Additionally, the OMG provides services to certain of the Company s managed funds and vehicles, which may reimburse the OMG for expenses either equal to the costs of services provided or as a percentage of invested capital. The OMG s revenues and expenses are not allocated to the Company s operating segments but the Company does consider the financial results of the OMG when evaluating its financial performance.

Segment Profit Measure: Realized income ( RI ), which includes fee related earnings ( FRE ) as a component, supplements and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Consolidated Statements of Operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.

RI, a non-GAAP measure, is an operating metric used by management to evaluate performance of the business based on operating performance and the contribution of each of the business segments to that performance, while removing the fluctuations of unrealized income and expenses, which may or may not be eventually realized at the levels presented and whose realizations depend more on future outcomes than current business operations. RI differs from income before taxes by excluding: (i) operating results of the Consolidated Funds; (ii) depreciation and amortization expense; (iii) the effects of changes arising from corporate actions; (iv) unrealized gains and losses related to carried interest, incentive fees and investment performance; and adjusts for certain other items that the Company believes are not indicative of operating performance. Changes arising from corporate actions include equity-based compensation expenses, the amortization of intangible assets, transaction costs associated with mergers, acquisitions and capital activities, underwriting costs and expenses incurred in connection with corporate reorganization. Placement fee adjustment represents the net portion of either expense deferral or amortization of upfront fees to placement agents that is presented to match the timing of expense recognition with the period over which management fees are expected to be earned from the associated fund for segment purposes but have been expensed in advance in accordance with GAAP. For periods in which the amortization of upfront fees for segment purposes is higher than the GAAP expense, the placement fee adjustment is presented as a reduction to RI. Management believes RI is a more appropriate metric to evaluate the Company s current business operations.

FRE, a non-GAAP measure that is a component of RI, is used to assess core operating performance by determining whether recurring revenue, primarily consisting of management fees and fee related performance revenues, is sufficient to cover operating expenses and to generate profits. FRE differs from income before taxes computed in accordance with GAAP as it excludes net performance income, investment income from Ares Funds and adjusts for certain other items that the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating performance. Fee related performance revenues, together with fee related performance compensation, is presented within FRE because it represents incentive fees from perpetual capital vehicles that is measured and eligible to be received on a recurring basis and not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments.

The Company s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer. The CODM makes operating decisions and assesses the performance of each of the Company s business segments based on financial and operating metrics and other data that is presented before giving effect to the consolidation of any of the Consolidated Funds. Consequently, all segment data excludes the assets, liabilities and operating results related to the Consolidated Funds and non-consolidated funds. Total assets by segments is not disclosed because such information is not used by the Company s CODM in evaluating the segments.

Many of the Ares Funds managed by the Company have mandates that allow for investing across different geographic regions, including North America, Europe, APAC and the Middle East. The primary geographic region in which the Company invests in is North America and the majority of its revenues are generated in North America.
