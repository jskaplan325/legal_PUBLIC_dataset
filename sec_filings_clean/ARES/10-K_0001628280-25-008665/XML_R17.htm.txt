RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Substantially all of the Company s revenue is earned from its affiliates. The related accounts receivable are included within due from affiliates within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, except that accrued carried interest, which is predominantly due from affiliated funds, is presented separately within investments within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

The Company has investment management agreements with the Ares Funds that it manages. In accordance with these agreements, these Ares Funds may bear certain operating costs and expenses which are initially paid by the Company and subsequently reimbursed by the Ares Funds.

Employees and other related parties may be permitted to participate in co-investment vehicles that generally invest in Ares Funds alongside fund investors. Participation is limited by law to individuals who qualify under applicable securities laws. These co-investment vehicles generally do not require these individuals to pay management fees, carried interest or incentive fees.
Carried interest and incentive fees from the funds can be distributed to professionals or their related entities on a current basis, subject, in the case of carried interest programs, to repayment by the subsidiary of the Company that acts as general partner of the relevant fund in the event that certain specified return thresholds are not ultimately achieved. The professionals have personally guaranteed, subject to certain limitations, the obligations of these subsidiaries in respect of this general partner obligation. Such guarantees are several, and not joint, and are limited to distributions received by the relevant recipient.
