Commitments and Contingencies Disclosure [Abstract]

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Indemnification Arrangements

Consistent with standard business practices in the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that contain indemnities for affiliates of the Company, persons acting on behalf of the Company or such affiliates and third parties. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the Company s maximum exposure under these arrangements cannot be determined and has not been recorded within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

Commitments

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had aggregate unfunded commitments to invest in funds it manages or to support certain strategic initiatives of $1,451.4 million and $1,030.6 million, respectively.

Guarantees

The guarantee agreements that the Company enters into with financial institutions are primarily to guarantee credit facilities held by certain funds. In the ordinary course of business, the guarantee of credit facilities held by funds may indicate control and result in consolidation of the fund. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company s maximum exposure to losses from guarantees was $1.1 million and $122.3 million, respectively.

Contingent Liabilities

WSM Earnout and WSM MIP

In connection with the WSM Acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company established two arrangements with the seller and certain professionals, including (i) an earnout arrangement ( WSM Earnout ) based on the achievement of revenue targets from the fundraising of a real estate equity fund; and (ii) a management incentive program (the WSM MIP ) based on the achievement of certain revenue targets associated with growing revenue sources from new business ventures. The WSM Earnout and WSM MIP represent contingent liabilities not to exceed $40.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively.

The portion of the WSM Earnout and WSM MIP attributable to the sellers is, 59.1% and 30.0%, respectively, and represents a component of purchase consideration that will be accounted for as contingent consideration. The fair value of these contingent liabilities as of the acquisition date was $17.6 million. The contingent liabilities are subject to change over the measurement periods, which will end: (i) on the final fundraising date of the real estate equity fund for the WSM Earnout; and (ii) no later than December 31, 2027 for the WSM MIP. Changes in fair value from the acquisition date will be recorded within other income (expense), net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Following the measurement period end dates, the contingent liabilities will be settled in cash. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the contingent liabilities was $17.6 million and recorded within accrued compensation within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

The portion of the WSM Earnout and WSM MIP attributable to the professionals is, 40.9% and 70.0%, respectively, and requires continued service through the measurement periods. The Company expects to settle the contingent liabilities at the Company's discretion with a component of cash and the remaining balance in equity awards as follows: (i) no less than 60.0% cash for the WSM Earnout; and (ii) no less than 50.0% cash for the WSM MIP. The WSM Earnout and WSM MIP are remeasured each period with incremental changes in fair value for the cash and equity components of these liabilities recognized within compensation and benefits expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the contingent liabilities were $15.6 million. Compensation expense of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 is presented within compensation and benefits within the Consolidated Statements of Operations with an equal offset presented within accrued compensation within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Following the measurement period end dates, the cash components will be paid and the equity awards will be granted at fair value for the balance of the liability. The unpaid liabilities at the respective measurement period end dates will be reclassified from liability to additional paid-in-capital. Any compensation expense associated with the WSM Earnout and WSM MIP that was not
previously recorded through the final measurement period end dates will be recognized as equity-based compensation expense over the remaining service periods of four years and two years for the WSM Earnout and WSM MIP, respectively.
Crescent Point MIP

In connection with the Crescent Point Acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company established a management incentive program (the Crescent Point MIP ) with certain professionals. The Crescent Point MIP represents a contingent liability not to exceed $75.0 million and is based on the achievement of revenue targets from the fundraising of a future private equity fund during the measurement period, which will end on the final fundraising date for the fund.

The Company expects to settle the liability with a combination of 33.0% cash and 67.0% equity awards. Expense associated with the cash and equity components are recognized ratably over the measurement period. The Crescent Point MIP is remeasured each period with incremental changes in fair value included within compensation and benefits expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Following the measurement period end date, the cash component will be paid and the equity component will be settled with shares of the Company s Class A common stock that will be granted at fair value.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the contingent liability was $75.0 million. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has recorded $25.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, within accrued compensation within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Compensation expense of $20.0 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is presented within compensation and benefits within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Infrastructure Debt MIP

In connection with the acquisition of AMP Capital s infrastructure debt platform (the Infrastructure Debt Acquisition ) during the first quarter of 2022, the Company established a management incentive program (the Infrastructure Debt MIP ) with certain professionals. The Infrastructure Debt MIP represents a contingent liability not to exceed $48.5 million and is based on the achievement of revenue targets from the fundraising of three infrastructure debt funds during the measurement periods.

The Company expects to settle each portion of the liability with a combination of 15.0% cash and 85.0% equity awards. Expense associated with the cash components are recognized ratably over the respective measurement periods, which will end on the final fundraising date for each of the infrastructure debt funds. Expense associated with the equity component is recognized ratably over the service periods, which will continue for four years beyond each of the measurement period end dates. The Infrastructure Debt MIP is remeasured each period with incremental changes in value included within compensation and benefits expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Following each of the measurement period end dates, the cash component will be paid and equity awards for the portion of the Infrastructure Debt MIP award earned will be granted at fair value. The unpaid liability at the respective measurement period end dates will be reclassified from liability to additional paid-in-capital and any difference between the Infrastructure Debt MIP award achieved at the respective measurement period end date and the previously recorded compensation expense will be recognized over the remaining four year service period as equity-based compensation expense.

The revenue target was achieved for one of the infrastructure debt funds during the fourth quarter of 2022 and the associated liability for this portion of the award was settled during the first quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum contingent liability associated with the Infrastructure Debt MIP for the two remaining infrastructure debt funds was $15.0 million.

During the fourth quarter of 2024, it was determined that it is not probable for one of the infrastructure debt funds to achieve its revenue target by the end of its measurement period. As a result, the Company reversed previously recorded expenses of $1.6 million associated with this fund from compensation and benefits within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the contingent liability associated with the remaining infrastructure debt fund was $9.0 million for both periods. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has recorded $4.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively, within accrued compensation within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Compensation expense associated with the remaining Infrastructure Debt MIP of $1.3 million, $1.5 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, is presented within compensation and benefits within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Carried Interest

Carried interest is affected by changes in the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds that are advised by the Company. Valuations, on an unrealized basis, can be significantly affected by a variety of external factors including, but not limited to, public equity market volatility, industry trading multiples and interest rates. Generally, if at the termination of a fund (and increasingly at interim points in the life of a fund), the fund has not achieved investment returns that exceed the preferred return threshold or the general partner has received net profits over the life of the fund in excess of its allocable share under the applicable partnership agreement, the Company will be obligated to repay carried interest that was received by the Company in excess of the amounts to which the Company is entitled. This contingent obligation is normally reduced by income taxes paid by the Company related to its carried interest.

Senior professionals of the Company who have received carried interest distributions are responsible for funding their proportionate share of any contingent repayment obligations. However, the governing agreements of certain of the Company s funds provide that if a current or former professional does not fund his or her respective share for such fund, then the Company may have to fund additional amounts beyond what was received in carried interest, although the Company will generally retain the right to pursue any remedies under such governing agreements against those carried interest recipients who fail to fund their obligations.

Additionally, at the end of the life of the funds there could be a payment due to a fund by the Company if the Company has recognized more carried interest than was ultimately earned. The general partner obligation amount, if any, will depend on final realized values of investments at the end of the life of the fund.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, if the Company assumed all existing investments were worthless, the amount of carried interest subject to potential repayment, net of tax distributions, which may differ from the recognition of revenue, would have been approximately $59.6 million and $78.5 million, respectively, of which approximately $39.5 million and $54.5 million, respectively, is reimbursable to the Company by certain professionals who are the recipients of such carried interest. Management believes the possibility of all of the investments becoming worthless is remote. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, if the funds were liquidated at their fair values, there would be no contingent repayment obligation or liability.

Litigation

From time to time, the Company is named as a defendant in legal actions relating to transactions conducted in the ordinary course of business. Although there can be no assurance of the outcome of such legal actions, in the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceeding or claim that would individually or in the aggregate materially affect its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
