Earnings Per Share [Abstract]

EARNINGS PER SHARE
11. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The Company has Class A and non-voting common stock outstanding. The non-voting common stock has the same economic rights as the Class A common stock; therefore, earnings per share is presented on a combined basis. Income of the Company has been allocated on a proportionate basis to the two common stock classes.

Basic earnings per share of Class A and non-voting common stock is computed by using the two-class method. Diluted earnings per share of Class A and non-voting common stock is computed using the more dilutive method of either the two-class method or the treasury stock and if-converted methods.

For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022, the two-class method was the more dilutive method. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the treasury stock method was the more dilutive method.

The computation of diluted earnings per share excludes the following restricted units and AOG Units as their effect would have been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method:

 Year ended December 31,
 2024 2023 2022

Restricted units N/A 2,071 N/A
AOG Units N/A 118,804,252 N/A

The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share:
