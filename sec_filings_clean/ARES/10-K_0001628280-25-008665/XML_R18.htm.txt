Income Tax Disclosure [Abstract]

INCOME TAXES
10. INCOME TAXES

The Company s effective income tax rate is dependent on many factors, including the estimated nature and amounts of income and expenses allocated to the non-controlling interests without being subject to federal, state and local income taxes at the corporate level. Additionally, the Company s effective tax rate is influenced by the amount of income tax provision recorded for any affiliated funds and co-investment vehicles that are consolidated in the Company s consolidated financial statements.
The Company files its tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for any years prior to 2021. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company does not believe the outcome of any future audit will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

The provision for income taxes attributable to the Company and the Consolidated Funds, consisted of the following:

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is probable that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining whether the deferred taxes are realizable, the Company considers the period of expiration of the tax asset, historical and projected taxable income, and tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce the amounts of deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on an assessment of positive and negative evidence, including estimates of future taxable income necessary to realize future deductible amounts.
The Company s income tax provision includes corporate income taxes and other entity level income taxes, as well as income taxes incurred by Consolidated Funds.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the valuation allowance for the Company s deferred tax assets was $0.9 million. The deferred tax assets related to operating losses in foreign jurisdictions and certain capital loss carryforwards do not meet the more likely than not threshold and have a valuation allowance recorded for the net balance.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $36.4 million and $10.6 million, respectively, of net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards and other tax attributes related to its Consolidated Funds available to reduce future income taxes for which a full valuation allowance has been provided. The NOL carryforwards generally have no expiry.

As of, and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no significant uncertain tax positions.
