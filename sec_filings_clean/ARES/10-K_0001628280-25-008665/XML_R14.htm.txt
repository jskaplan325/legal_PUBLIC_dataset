The Company typically incurs and pays debt issuance costs when entering into a new debt obligation or when amending an existing debt agreement. Debt issuance costs related to the various senior notes (the Senior Notes ) and the subordinated notes (the Subordinated Notes ) are recorded as a reduction of the corresponding debt obligation, and debt issuance costs related to the Credit Facility are included within other assets within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. All debt issuance costs are amortized over the remaining term of the related obligation into interest expense within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The following table presents the activity of the Company s debt issuance costs:

Loan Obligations of the Consolidated CLOs

Total loan obligations of Consolidated CLOs $ 9,672,189 $ 12,345,657

(1)The notes do not have contractual interest rates; instead, holders of the notes receive a variable rate of interest amounting to the excess cash flows generated by each Consolidated CLO.

Loan obligations of the Consolidated CLOs are collateralized by the assets held by the Consolidated CLOs, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, corporate loans, corporate bonds and other securities. The assets of one Consolidated CLO may not be used to satisfy the liabilities of another Consolidated CLO. Loan obligations of the Consolidated CLOs include floating rate notes, deferrable floating rate notes, revolving lines of credit and subordinated notes. Amounts borrowed under the notes are repaid based on available cash flows subject to priority of payments under each Consolidated CLO s governing documents. Based on the terms of these facilities, the creditors of the facilities have no recourse to the Company.
Credit Facilities of the Consolidated Funds
Certain Consolidated Funds maintain credit facilities to fund investments between capital drawdowns. These facilities generally are collateralized by the net assets of the Consolidated Funds or the unfunded capital commitments of the Consolidated Funds limited partners, bear an annual commitment fee based on unfunded commitments and contain various affirmative and negative covenants and reporting obligations, including restrictions on additional indebtedness, liens, margin stock, affiliate transactions, dividends and distributions, release of capital commitments and portfolio asset dispositions. The creditors of these facilities have no recourse to the Company and only have recourse to a subsidiary of the Company to the extent the debt is guaranteed by such subsidiary. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Consolidated Funds were in compliance with all covenants under such credit facilities.
The Consolidated Funds had the following revolving bank credit facilities outstanding:
