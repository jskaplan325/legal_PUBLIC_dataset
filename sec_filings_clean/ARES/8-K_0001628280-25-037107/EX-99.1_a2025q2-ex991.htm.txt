ARES MANAGEMENT CORPORATION REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2025 RESULTS

NEW YORK--Ares Management Corporation (NYSE ARES) today reported its financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2025.

GAAP net income attributable to Ares Management Corporation was $137.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. On a basic and diluted basis, net income attributable to Ares Management Corporation per share of Class A and non-voting common stock was $0.46 for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.

After-tax realized income was $367.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. After-tax realized income per share of Class A common stock was $1.03 for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Fee related earnings were $409.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.

 We generated strong second quarter results, growing AUM, fee paying AUM and management fees by 24% or more year over year, said Michael Arougheti, Chief Executive Officer of Ares. Our AUM benefitted from our second highest level of quarterly gross fundraising coupled with record quarterly market appreciation driven by strong investment performance across our major strategies. With our diversified suite of funds and products seeing strong investor interest across our institutional, wealth and insurance channels, we believe we are on pace to meet or exceed our previous annual record for fundraising.

 Our second quarter includes the first full quarter of financials from the GCP International acquisition, and we believe we are on track to meet our financial goals for this business, including greater than originally expected synergies that will be gradually realized over time, said Jarrod Phillips, Chief Financial Officer of Ares. With an improving transaction environment and a record amount of available capital at more than $150 billion, we believe we are well positioned to generate meaningful future earnings growth.

Common Stock Dividend

Ares declared a quarterly dividend of $1.12 per share of its Class A and non-voting common stock, payable on September 30, 2025 to its Class A and non-voting common stockholders of record at the close of business on September 16, 2025.

Dividend Reinvestment Program
