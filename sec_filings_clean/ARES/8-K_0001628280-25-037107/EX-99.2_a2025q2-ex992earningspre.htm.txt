Corporate income taxes represent accrued corporate taxes, net of deductions, to be paid or benefits to be received by Ares: Corporate income taxes excludes the effects of $29.1 million, $4.9 million for Q2-25, Q2-24, and $20.2 million, $9.2 million for YTD-25, YTD-24, respectively, of deferred income tax primarily related to net unrealized performance income and net unrealized investment income, as these incomes have been excluded from RI. The primary differences between the current portion of taxable income and RI relate to the timing of certain items, primarily vesting of equity awards, exercise of stock options, payment of placement fees, and amortization of intangibles. Tax deductions associated with the vesting of restricted stock units and the exercise of options reduced our current tax provision by $30.0 million, $16.5 million and $59.3 million, $31.0 million for Q2-25, Q2-24 and YTD-25, YTD-24 respectively. The inclusion of the benefit in the after-tax RI per share calculation had the effect of increasing this metric by $0.13, $0.08 and $0.26, $0.15 decreased the RI cash tax rate by 11.2%, 7.2% and 11.0%, 7.5% for Q2-25, Q2-24 and YTD-25, YTD-24 respectively, from the Company s statutory tax rate of 23.5% for both Q2-25 and YTD-25 and 24.0% for both Q2-24 and YTD-24, respectively. Corporate Income taxes represent the current portion of our GAAP tax provision and is presented before giving effect to the tax benefits recorded in connection with the Tax Receivable Agreement ( TRA ). As a result, a higher corporate income tax is used to calculate after-tax RI per share than the current taxes paid by the Company. The current tax benefits associated with the TRA, which represent 85.0% of the tax benefits, were $6.3 million, $3.1 million and $12.6 million, $5.1 million for Q2-25, Q2-24 and YTD-25, YTD-24 respectively. 2. Weighted-average shares used for after-tax RI per share for Q2-25 and Q2-24 were 344,928,366 and 320,635,767, respectively. YTD after-tax realized income per share represents the sum of the last two quarters. 3. Weighted-average shares used for after-tax RI per share of Class A and non-voting common stock for Q2-25 and Q2-24 were 234,331,758 and 202,670,028, respectively. YTD after-tax realized income per share represents the sum of the last two quarters.

22 Weighted-Average Shares 1. Represents proportional dilutive impact based upon the weighted average percentage of Ares Operating Group owned by Ares Management Corporation (67.03% and 63.21% as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively). 2. Represents units exchangeable for shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. 3. We apply the if-converted and treasury stock methods to determine the dilutive weighted-average common shares represented by (i) our Series B mandatory convertible preferred stock convertible to shares of Class A common stock; and (ii) restricted units to be settled in shares of Class A common stock. Under the if-converted method, shares of our Series B mandatory convertible preferred stock are presumed to be converted to shares of Class A common stock as of the beginning of the period, thus increasing the weighted-average number of shares and the dilutive effect of these securities. Under the treasury stock method, compensation expense attributed to future services and not yet recognized is presumed to be used to acquire outstanding shares of Class A common stock, thus reducing the weighted-average number of shares and the dilutive effect of these awards. 4. Excludes Class B common stock and Class C common stock as they are not entitled to any economic benefits of Ares in an event of dissolution, liquidation or winding up of Ares.

Please refer to Financial Details - Segments on slides 19-20 for complete financial results. Credit Group 1. The Credit Group had ~615 investment and investor relations professionals, ~285 active funds, ~1,900 portfolio companies and ~1,950 alternative credit investments as of June 30, 2025. 2. Composite returns are calculated by asset-weighting the underlying fund-level time-weighted returns. Returns include the reinvestment of income and other earnings from securities or other investments and reflect the deduction of all trading expenses. Gross time-weighted returns do not reflect the deduction of management fees, carried interest, as applicable, or other expenses, while net time-weighted returns are after giving effect to these items. We believe aggregated performance returns reflect overall quarterly performance returns in a strategy, but are not necessarily investable funds or products themselves. Additional information for performance by strategy is as follows: Performance for the alternative credit strategy is represented by the composite made up of Pathfinder I and Pathfinder II. The net returns were 2.1% for Q2-25 and 8.6% for Q2-25 LTM. Performance for the opportunistic credit strategy is represented by the composite made up of ASOF I and ASOF II. The net fund-level returns were 3.8% for Q2-25 and 11.0% for Q2-25 LTM. Performance for the U.S. senior direct lending strategy is represented by the composite made up of SDL I and SDL II levered feeder funds. The net returns were 2.2% for Q2-25 and 10.3% for Q2-25 LTM. The gross and net returns for the composite made up of the SDL I and SDL II unlevered feeder funds were 2.2% and 1.7% for Q2-25, respectively, and 10.2% and 7.9% for Q2-25 LTM, respectively. Performance for the U.S. junior direct lending strategy is represented by the composite made up of PCS I and PCS II. The net returns were 4.1% for Q2-25 and 10.2% for Q2-25 LTM. Performance for the European direct lending strategy is represented by the composite made up of ACE IV, ACE V and ACE VI levered Euro-denominated feeder funds. Returns presented on slide 14 for the European direct lending composite are Euro-denominated as this is the base denomination of the funds. The net returns were 1.6% for Q2-25 and 7.6% for Q2-25 LTM. The gross and net returns for the composite made up of ACE IV, ACE V and ACE VI U.S. dollar denominated feeder funds were 3.0% and 2.2% for Q2-25, respectively, and 13.0% and 9.5% for Q2-25 LTM, respectively. Performance for the APAC credit strategy is represented by the composite made up of SSG V and SSG VI. The net returns were 3.0% for Q2-25 and 15.9% for Q2-25 LTM. 3. Since inception returns are annualized. 4. Returns are time-weighted rates of return and include the reinvestment of income and other earnings from securities or other investments and reflect the deduction of all trading expenses. Net returns are calculated using the fund s NAV and assume dividends are reinvested at the closest quarter-end NAV to the relevant quarterly ex-dividend dates. Additional information related to ARCC can be found in its filings with the SEC, which are not part of this report. 5. Returns are time-weighted rates of return and include the reinvestment of income and other earnings from securities or other investments and reflect the deduction of all trading expenses. Returns are shown for institutional share class. Shares of other classes may have lower returns due to higher selling commissions and fees. Net returns are calculated using the fund s NAV and assume distributions are reinvested at the NAV on the date of distribution. Additional information related to CADC and ASIF can be found in its filings with the SEC, which are not part of this report. 6. Returns are time-weighted rates of return and include the reinvestment of income and other earnings from securities or other investments and reflect the deduction of all trading expenses. The fund is made up of a Main Class ( Class M ) and a Constrained Class ( Class C ). Class M includes investors electing to participate in all investments and Class C includes investors electing to be excluded from exposure to liquid investments. Returns presented in the table are for onshore Class M. The current quarter gross and net returns for Class M (offshore) are 3.0% and 2.2%, respectively. The year-to- date gross and net returns for Class M (offshore) are 6.1% and 4.4%, respectively. The since inception gross and net returns for Class M (offshore) are 11.7% and 8.3%, respectively. The current quarter gross and net returns for Class C (offshore) are 2.8% and 2.1%, respectively. The year-to-date gross and net returns for Class M (offshore) are 5.5% and 4.0%, respectively. The since inception gross and net returns for Class C (offshore) are 11.3% and 8.1%, respectively. 7. Returns are time-weighted rates of return and include the reinvestment of income and other earnings from securities or other investments and reflect the deduction of all trading expenses. Returns are shown for the Euro hedged distributing institutional share class. Shares of other classes may have lower returns due to higher selling commissions and fees, and currency hedging. Actual individual stockholder returns will vary. Net returns are calculated using the fund s NAV and assume distributions are reinvested at the NAV on the date of distribution. 8. For funds other than our opportunistic credit funds, realized value represent the sum of all cash distributions to all partners and if applicable, exclude tax and incentive distributions made to the general partner. For our opportunistic credit funds, realized value represent the sum of all cash distributions to the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, exclude tax and incentive distributions made to the general partner. 9. Unrealized value represents the fund's NAV reduced by the accrued incentive allocation, if applicable. There can be no assurance that unrealized values will be realized at the valuations indicated. For funds other than our opportunistic credit funds, the unrealized value is based on all partners. For our opportunistic credit funds, the unrealized value is based on the fee-paying limited partners. 10. The gross multiple of invested capital ( MoIC ) is calculated at the fund-level and is based on the interests of the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, excludes interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The gross MoIC is before giving effect to management fees, carried interest and other expenses, as applicable, but after giving effect to credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Early in the life of a fund, the gross fund-level MoICs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 11. The net MoIC is calculated at the fund-level and is based on the interests of the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, excludes those interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The net MoIC is after giving effect to management fees and carried interest, other expenses and credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Early in the life of a fund, the net fund-level MoICs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 12. The gross IRR is an annualized since inception gross internal rate of return of cash flows to and from the fund and the fund s residual value at the end of the measurement period. Gross IRR reflects returns to the fee-paying limited partners and, if applicable, excludes interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The cash flow dates used in the gross IRR calculation are based on the actual dates of the cash flows. The gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to management fees, carried interest and other expenses, as applicable, but after giving effect to credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Gross fund-level IRRs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility.

39 Investment Group Highlights and Fund Performance Endnotes (cont'd) Real Assets Group (cont d) 5. Performance is measured by total return, which includes income and appreciation and reinvestment of all distributions for the respective time period. Returns are shown for institutional share class. Shares of other classes may have lower returns due to higher selling commissions and fees. Actual individual stockholder returns will vary. Net returns are calculated using the fund s NAV and assume distributions are reinvested at the NAV on the date of distribution. The inception date used in the calculation of the since inception return is the date in which the first shares of common stock were sold after converting to a NAV-based REIT. 6. Performance is measured by total return, which includes income and appreciation and reinvestment of all distributions for the respective time period. Actual individual stockholder returns will vary. Net returns are calculated using the fund s NAV and assume distributions are reinvested at NAV on the semi-annual period-end date. NAVs are calculated semi-annually in February and August, and therefore, only the since inception return is presented. The inception date used in the calculation of the since inception return is the date in which the fund's investment units began to be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The since inception return is calculated based on the most recent NAV date. Additional information related to J-REIT can be found in its materials posted to its website, which are not part of this report. 7.

Net returns are calculated using the fund s NAV and assume distributions are reinvested at the NAV on the date of distribution. 8. Returns are time-weighted rates of return and include the reinvestment of income and other earnings from securities or other investments and reflect the deduction of all trading expenses. Gross returns do not reflect the deduction of management fees, incentive fees, as applicable, or other expenses. Net returns are calculated by subtracting the applicable management fees, incentive fees, as applicable and other expenses from the gross returns on a quarterly basis. 9. For the real estate funds (excluding EIP II), USPF IV and EIF V, realized value represents distributions of operating income, interest income, other fees and proceeds from realizations of interests in portfolio investments. For IDF V, IDF IV and EIP II, realized proceeds include distributions of operating income, sales and financing proceeds received to the limited partners. Realized value excludes any proceeds related to bridge financings. 10. For the real estate funds (excluding EIP II), USPF IV and EIF V, the unrealized value represents the fair value of remaining investments. For IDF V, IDF IV and EIP II, unrealized value represents the fund's NAV reduced by the accrued incentive allocation, if applicable. There can be no assurance that unrealized values will be realized at the valuations indicated. 11. For the real estate funds (excluding EIP II), USPF IV and EIF V, the gross MoIC is calculated at the investment-level and is based on the interests of all partners. The gross MoIC is before giving effect to management fees, carried interest, as applicable, and other expenses. For IDF V, IDF IV and EIP II, the gross MoIC is calculated at the fund-level and is based on the interests of the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, excludes interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The gross MoIC is before giving effect to management fees, carried interest, as applicable, and other expenses, but after giving effect to credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Early in the life of a fund, the gross fund-level MoICs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 12. The net MoIC is calculated at the fund-level and is based on the interests of the fee-paying limited partners and, if applicable, excludes interests attributable to the non fee-paying limited partners and/ or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The net MoIC is after giving effect to management fees, carried interest, as applicable, credit facility interest expense, as applicable, and other expenses. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Early in the life of a fund, the net fund-level MoICs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 13. For the real estate funds (excluding EIP II), USPF IV and EIF V, the gross IRR is an annualized since inception gross internal rate of return of cash flows to and from investments and the residual value of the investments at the end of the measurement period. Gross IRRs reflect returns to all partners. For the real estate funds (excluding EIP II), cash flows used in the gross IRR calculation are assumed to occur at quarter-end. For USPF IV and EIF V, cash flows used in the gross IRR calculation are assumed to occur at month-end. The gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to management fees, carried interest as applicable, and other expenses. For IDF V, IDF IV and EIP II, the gross IRR is an annualized since inception gross internal rate of return of cash flows to and from the fund and the fund s residual value at the end of the measurement period. Gross IRR reflects returns to the fee-paying limited partners and, if applicable, excludes interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The cash flow dates used in the gross IRR calculation are based on the actual dates of the cash flows. The gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to management fees, carried interest and other expenses, but after giving effect to credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Gross fund-level IRRs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 14. The net IRR is an annualized since inception net internal rate of return of cash flows to and from the fund and the fund s residual value at the end of the measurement period. Net IRRs reflect returns to the fee-paying limited partners and, if applicable, exclude interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The cash flow dates used in the net IRR calculations are based on the actual dates of the cash flows. The net IRRs are calculated after giving effect to management fees and carried interest, other expenses and credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Net fund-level IRRs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 15. IDF V is made up of U.S. Dollar hedged, Euro unhedged, GBP hedged, Yen hedged, and single investor parallel funds.

EPEP II is made up of dual currency investors and Euro currency investors. The gross and net MoIC and gross and net IRR presented in the table are for dual currency investors as dual currency investors represent the largest group of investors in the fund. Multiples exclude foreign currency gains and losses since dual currency investors fund capital contributions and receive distributions in local deal currency (GBP or EUR) and therefore, do not realize foreign currency gains or losses. The gross and net IRRs for the euro currency investors, which include foreign currency gains and losses, are 9.0% and 5.3%, respectively. The gross and net MoIC for the euro currency investors are 1.2x and 1.1x, respectively.

The Private Equity Group had ~85 investment and investor relations professionals, ~65 portfolio companies and ~60 active funds as of June 30, 2025. 2. All returns are gross fund-level time-weighted rates of return and include the reinvestment of income and other earnings from securities or other investments, and also reflect the deduction of all trading expenses. Gross time-weighted returns do not reflect the deduction of management fees, carried interest, or other expenses, as applicable, while net time-weighted returns are after giving effect to these items. We believe aggregated performance returns reflect overall quarterly performance returns in a strategy, but are not necessarily investable funds or products themselves. Additional information for performance by strategy is as follows: Performance for the corporate private equity strategy is represented by the composite made up of ACOF V and ACOF VI. The net fund-level returns were 2.8% for Q2-25 and 3.4% for Q2-25 LTM. 3. Realized value represents the sum of all cash dividends, interest income, other fees and cash proceeds from realizations of interests in portfolio investments. Realized value excludes any proceeds related to bridge financings. 4. Unrealized value represents the fair market value of remaining investments. Unrealized value does not take into account any bridge financings. There can be no assurance that unrealized investments will be realized at the valuations indicated. 5. The gross MoIC is calculated at the fund-level and is based on the interests of the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, excludes interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The gross MoIC is before giving effect to management fees, carried interest, as applicable, and other expenses, but after giving effect to credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The gross MoICs are also calculated before giving effect to any bridge financings. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Early in the life of a fund, the gross fund-level MoICs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 6. The net MoIC is calculated at the fund-level. The net MoIC is based on the interests of the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, excludes interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or performance fees. The net MoIC is after giving effect to management fees, carried interest, as applicable, and other expenses. The net MoICs are also calculated before giving effect to any bridge financings. Inclusive of bridge financings, the net MoIC would be 1.8x for ACOF IV, 1.3x for ACOF V, 1.4x for ACOF VI and 0.6x for AEOF. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Early in the life of a fund, the net fund-level MoICs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility.

The Secondaries Group had ~100 investment and investor relations professionals, ~950 underlying limited partnership interests and ~85 active funds as of June 30, 2025. 2. Returns presented on slide 17 reflect APMF net returns for Q2-25 / since inception Q2-25, respectively. Returns are time-weighted rates of return and include the reinvestment of income and other earnings from securities or other investments and reflect the deduction of all trading expenses. Returns are shown for institutional share class. Shares of other classes may have lower returns due to higher selling commissions and fees. Net returns are calculated using the fund s NAV and assume distributions are reinvested at the NAV on the date of distribution. Additional information related to APMF can be found in its filings with the SEC, which are not part of this report. 3. Gross time-weighted returns do not reflect the deduction of management fees, carried interest, or other expenses, as applicable, while net time-weighted returns are after giving effect to these items. For all funds in the Secondaries Group, returns are calculated from results of the underlying portfolio that are generally reported on a three month lag and may not include the impact of economic and market activities occurring in the current reporting period. Additional information for performance by strategy is as follows: Performance for the private equity secondaries is represented by the composite made up of LEP XVI and LEP XVII. The net returns were 2.5% for Q2-25 and (4.4)% for Q2-25 LTM. Performance for the real estate secondaries is represented by the composite made up of LREF VIII and LREF IX. The net returns were 0.3% for Q2-25 and 0.1% for Q2-25 LTM. 4. Since inception returns are annualized. 5. Realized value represents the sum of all cash distributions to all limited partners and if applicable, exclude tax and incentive distributions made to the general partner. 6. Unrealized value represents the limited partners share of fund s NAV reduced by the accrued incentive allocation, if applicable. There can be no assurance that unrealized values will be realized at the valuations indicated. 7. The gross MoIC is calculated at the fund-level and is based on the interests of all partners. If applicable, limiting the gross MoIC to exclude interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner who does not pay management fees or carried interest would have no material impact on the result. The gross MoIC is before giving effect to management fees, carried interest, as applicable, and other expenses, but after giving effect to credit facility interest expenses, as applicable.

Investment Group Highlights and Fund Performance Endnotes (cont'd)

42 Glossary Ares Operating Group Entities Ares Operating Group entities or an AOG Entity refers to, collectively, Ares Holdings L.P. ( Ares Holdings ) and any future entity designated by our board of directors in its sole discretion as an Ares Operating Group entity. Ares Operating Group Unit Ares Operating Group Unit or an AOG Unit refers to, collectively, a partnership unit in the Ares Operating Group entities. Assets Under Management Assets Under Management or AUM generally refers to the assets we manage. For our funds other than those noted below, our AUM represents the sum of the net asset value ( NAV ) of such funds, the drawn and undrawn debt (at the fund-level including amounts subject to restrictions) and uncalled committed capital (including commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods). NAV generally refers to fair value of the assets of the fund less the liabilities of the fund but may represent carrying value of assets and liabilities of funds that are not reported at fair value. For the CLOs we manage, our AUM is equal to initial principal of collateral adjusted for paydowns. For Real Assets funds that we manage where management fees are based on gross asset value, net operating income or similar metrics including their equivalents ( GAV ), our AUM represents the sum of the GAV of such funds, undrawn debt (including any amounts subject to restrictions) and uncalled committed capital (including commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods). GAV typically refers to the fair value of a fund s total assets. AUM also includes the proceeds raised in the initial public offerings of special purpose acquisition companies ( SPACs ) sponsored by us, less any redemptions. AUM Not Yet Paying Fees AUM Not Yet Paying Fees (also referred to as shadow AUM ) refers to AUM that is not currently paying fees and is eligible to earn management fees upon deployment. Available Capital Available Capital (also referred to as dry powder ) is comprised of uncalled committed capital and undrawn amounts under credit facilities and may include AUM that may be canceled or not otherwise available to invest. Consolidated Funds Consolidated Funds refers collectively to certain Ares funds, co-investment vehicles, CLOs and SPACs that are required under GAAP to be consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. Dividend Policy In the normal course of business, we expect to pay dividends to our Class A and non-voting common stockholders that are aligned with our expected annual fee related earnings after an allocation of current taxes paid. For the purpose of determining this amount, we allocate the total current taxes paid between FRE and realized incentive and investment income in a manner that is expected to be disproportionate to earnings generated by these metrics and the actual taxes paid on these metrics should they be measured separately. Additionally, our methodology uses the tax benefits from certain expenses that are not included in these non-GAAP metrics, such as equity-based compensation from the vesting of restricted units, and the exercise of stock options and from the amortization of intangible assets, among others. The portion of the current tax allocated to performance and net investment income is calculated by multiplying the statutory tax rate currently in effect by the realized performance and net investment income attributable to the Company. We subtract this amount from the total current tax and the remainder is allocated to FRE. We use this method to allocate the portion of the current income tax provision to FRE to approximate the amount of cash that is available to pay dividends to our stockholders. If cash flows from FRE were insufficient to fund dividends over a sustained period of time, we expect that we would reduce dividends or suspend paying such dividends. Accordingly, there is no assurance that dividends would continue at the current levels or at all. Effective Management Fee Rate Effective management fee rate represents annualized management fees divided by the average fee paying AUM for the period, excluding the impact of catch-up fees.

43 Glossary (Cont'd) Fee Paying AUM Fee Paying AUM or FPAUM refers to the AUM from which we directly earn management fees. FPAUM is equal to the sum of all the individual fee bases of our funds that directly contribute to our management fees. For our funds other than CLOs, our FPAUM represents the amount of limited partner capital commitments for certain closed-end funds within the reinvestment period, the amount of limited partner invested capital for the aforementioned closed-end funds beyond the reinvestment period and the portfolio value, GAV or NAV. For the CLOs we manage, our FPAUM is equal to the gross amount of aggregate collateral balance, at par, adjusted for defaulted or discounted collateral. Fee Related Earnings Fee Related Earnings or FRE , a non-GAAP measure that is a component of Realized Income, is used to assess core operating performance by determining whether recurring revenue, primarily consisting of management fees and fee related performance revenues, is sufficient to cover operating expenses and to generate profits. FRE differs from income before taxes computed in accordance with GAAP as FRE excludes net performance income, investment income from our funds and adjusts for certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance. Fee related performance revenues, together with fee related performance compensation, is presented within FRE because it represents incentive fees from perpetual capital vehicles that are measured and eligible to be received on a recurring basis and are not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments. Fee Related Earnings Margin Fee related earnings margin represents the quotient of fee related earnings and the sum of segment management fees, fee related performance revenues and other fees. Fee Related Performance Revenues Fee Related Performance Revenues refers to incentive fees from perpetual capital vehicles that are: (i) measured and eligible to be received on a recurring basis; and (ii) not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments. Certain vehicles are subject to hold back provisions that limit the amounts paid in a particular year. Such hold back amounts may be paid in subsequent years, subject to their extended performance conditions. Gross Capital Deployment Gross Capital Deployment refers to the aggregate amount of capital invested by our funds during a given period, and includes investments made by our drawdown funds and perpetual capital vehicles and new capital raised and invested by our open- ended managed accounts, sub-advised accounts and CLOs, but excludes capital that is reinvested (after receiving repayments of capital) by our open-ended managed accounts, sub-advised accounts and CLOs. Incentive Eligible AUM Incentive Eligible AUM or IEAUM generally refers to the AUM of our funds and other entities from which carried interest and incentive fees may be generated, regardless of whether or not they are currently generating carried interest and incentive fees. It generally represents the NAV plus uncalled equity or total assets plus uncalled debt, as applicable, of our funds for which we are entitled to receive carried interest and incentive fees, excluding capital committed by us and our professionals (from which we generally do not earn carried interest and incentive fees), as well as proceeds raised in the initial public offerings of SPACs sponsored by us, less any redemptions. With respect to the AUM of certain publicly-traded and perpetual wealth vehicles that generate Part II Fees, only Part II Fees may be generated from IEAUM. Incentive Generating AUM Incentive Generating AUM or IGAUM refers to the AUM of our funds and other entities that are currently generating carried interest and incentive fees on a realized or unrealized basis. It generally represents the NAV or total assets of our funds, as applicable, for which we are entitled to receive carried interest and incentive fees, excluding capital committed by us and our professionals (from which we generally do not earn carried interest and incentive fees). Publicly-traded and perpetual wealth vehicles that generate Part II Fees are only included in IGAUM when Part II Fees are being generated.

44 Glossary (Cont'd) Management Fees Management Fees refers to fees we earn for advisory services provided to our funds, which are generally based on a defined percentage of fair value of assets, total commitments, invested capital, gross asset value, net asset value, net investment income, total assets or par value of the investment portfolios managed by us. Management fees include Part I Fees, a quarterly fee based on the net investment income of certain funds. Net Inflows of Capital Net Inflows of Capital refers to net new commitments during the period, including equity and debt commitments and gross inflows into our open-ended managed accounts and sub-advised accounts, as well as new debt and equity issuances by our publicly-traded vehicles minus redemptions from our open-ended funds, managed accounts and sub-advised accounts. Operations Management Group In addition to our reportable segments, we have an Operations Management Group (the OMG ) that consists of shared resource groups to support our reportable segments by providing infrastructure and administrative support in the areas of accounting/finance, operations, information technology, strategy and relationship management, legal, compliance and human resources. The OMG includes Ares Wealth Management Solutions, LLC ( AWMS ) that facilitates the product development, distribution, marketing and client management activities for investment offerings in the global wealth management channel. The OMG s revenues and expenses are not allocated to our reportable segments but we consider the cost structure of the OMG when evaluating our financial performance. Our management uses this information to assess the performance of our reportable segments and OMG, and we believe that this information enhances the ability of stockholders to analyze our performance. Our Funds Our Funds refers to the funds, alternative asset companies, trusts, co-investment vehicles and other entities and accounts that are managed or co-managed by the Ares Operating Group, and which are structured to pay fees. It also includes funds managed by Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P., a wholly owned portfolio company of Ares Capital Corporation (NASDAQ: ARCC) ( ARCC ) and an SEC-registered investment adviser. Part I Fees Part I Fees refers to a quarterly fee on the net investment income of certain publicly-traded or perpetual wealth vehicles. Such fees are classified as management fees as they are predictable and recurring in nature, not subject to contingent repayment and generally cash-settled each quarter, unless subject to a payment deferral. Part II Fees Part II Fees refers to fees from certain publicly-traded or perpetual wealth vehicles that are paid in arrears as of the end of each calendar year when the respective cumulative aggregate realized capital gains exceed the cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, less the aggregate amount of respective Part II Fees paid in all prior years since inception. Performance Income Performance Income refers to income we earn based on the performance of a fund that is generally based on certain specific hurdle rates as defined in the fund s investment management or partnership agreements and may be either incentive fees earned from funds with stated investment periods or carried interest.

45 Glossary (Cont'd) Perpetual Capital Perpetual Capital refers to the AUM of publicly-traded, perpetual wealth vehicles, commingled funds and managed accounts that have an indefinite term, are not in liquidation, and for which there is no immediate requirement to return invested capital to investors upon the realization of investments. Perpetual Capital - Managed Accounts refers to managed accounts for single investors primarily in illiquid strategies that meet the perpetual capital criteria. Perpetual Capital - Private Commingled Funds refers to commingled funds that meet the perpetual capital criteria, not including our publicly-traded or perpetual wealth vehicles. Perpetual capital may be withdrawn by investors under certain conditions, including through an election to redeem an investor s fund investment or to terminate the investment management agreement, which in certain cases may be terminated on 30 days prior written notice. In addition, the investment management or advisory agreements of certain of our publicly-traded and perpetual wealth vehicles have one year terms, which are subject to annual renewal by such vehicles. Realized Income Realized Income or RI , a non-GAAP measure, is an operating metric used by management to evaluate performance of the business based on operating performance and the contribution of each of the business segments to that performance, while removing the fluctuations of unrealized income and losses, which may or may not be eventually realized at the levels presented and whose realizations depend more on future outcomes than current business operations. RI differs from income before taxes by excluding: (i) operating results of our Consolidated Funds; (ii) depreciation and amortization expense; (iii) the effects of changes arising from corporate actions; and (iv) unrealized gains and losses related to carried interest, incentive fees and investment performance; and adjusting for certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance. Changes arising from corporate actions include equity-based compensation expenses, the amortization of intangible assets, transaction costs associated with mergers, acquisitions and capital activities, underwriting costs and expenses incurred in connection with corporate reorganization. Placement fee adjustment represents the net portion of either expense deferral or amortization of upfront fees to placement agents that is presented to match the timing of expense recognition with the period over which management fees are expected to be earned from the associated fund for segment purposes but have been expensed in advance in accordance with GAAP. For periods in which the amortization of upfront fees for segment purposes is higher than the GAAP expense, the placement fee adjustment is presented as a reduction to RI. After-tax RI is RI less the current income tax provision. For this purpose, the current income tax provision represents the sum of (i) taxes paid or payable as reflected in the Company s GAAP financial statements for the period and (ii) amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement for which a tax benefit was included in the current period provision. The current income tax provision reflects the tax benefits associated with deductions available to the Company on certain expense items that have been excluded from the underlying calculation of RI, such as equity-based compensation deductions. If tax deductions related to the vesting of restricted units and exercise of stock options were excluded, the resulting current income tax provision and the implied tax rate would be higher, which would reduce After-tax RI. The assumptions applied in calculating our current income tax provision as presented under U.S. GAAP and in determining After-tax RI are consistent. Management believes that utilizing the current income tax provision, calculated as described above, in determining After-tax RI is meaningful because it increases comparability between periods and more accurately reflects amounts that are available for distribution to stockholders.
