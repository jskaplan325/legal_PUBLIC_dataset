 OPINIONS

We are of the opinion, based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications stated in this letter, that:

Corporate Opinions

1.
 The Qu&eacute;bec Guarantor has been duly formed and organized, is validly existing as a limited partnership
under the laws of Qu&eacute;bec, is duly registered under An Act respecting the legal publicity of enterprises (Qu&eacute;bec) (the Publicity Act ), is not in default of its obligations to file annual declarations pursuant
to the Publicity Act and is not in noncompliance with any request made under Section 73 of the Publicity Act.

2.

all necessary corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by the Qu&eacute;bec Guarantor of its obligation under the Indenture and the Guarantees.

3.
 Assuming due authentication of the Notes by the Trustee and upon payment for and delivery of the Notes in
accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, the Guarantees will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Qu&eacute;bec Guarantor enforceable against the Qu&eacute;bec Guarantor in accordance with their terms.

4.
 Assuming due authentication of the Notes by the Trustee and upon payment for and delivery of the Notes in
accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, the execution and delivery by the Qu&eacute;bec Guarantor of the Indenture and the Guarantees, and the performance by the Qu&eacute;bec Guarantor of its obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the
Notes Offering will not, as applicable, contravene any provision of Qu&eacute;bec law or the provisions of the Partnership Agreement and the declaration of registration, as amended, of the Qu&eacute;bec Guarantor or any agreement or other instrument
binding upon the Qu&eacute;bec Guarantor.
