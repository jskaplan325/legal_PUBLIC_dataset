 On September 19, 2025, The Carlyle Group Inc. (the Issuer ) and Carlyle Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.L.C., CG Subsidiary Holdings L.L.C. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P., each indirect subsidiaries of the Issuer (the Guarantors ), entered into a senior notes indenture, dated September 19, 2025 (the Base Indenture ), as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, dated September 19, 2025 (the First Supplemental Indenture and, together with the Base Indenture, the Indenture ), with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee ), relating to the issuance by the Issuer of $800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.050% Senior Notes due 2035 (the Notes ). The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (Registration No. 333-270745), as amended by the post-effective amendment no. 1 thereto (as amended, the Registration Statement ).

 The Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.050% per annum accruing from September 19, 2025. Interest is payable semiannually on March 19 and September 19 of each year, commencing on March 19, 2026. The Notes will mature on September 19, 2035, unless earlier redeemed. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the Guarantees ), jointly and severally, by each of the Guarantors. The Guarantees are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Guarantors.

 The Indenture includes covenants, including limitations on the Issuer s and the Guarantors ability to, subject to exceptions, merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets and create liens on assets. The Indenture also provides for customary events of default and further provides that the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. In the case of specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization, the principal amount of the Notes and any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes automatically will become due and payable. Prior to June 19, 2035 (three months prior to the maturity date), the Notes may be redeemed at the Issuer s option in whole at any time or in part from time to time at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Notes may be redeemed at the Issuer s option in whole at any time or in part from time to time on or after June 19, 2035 (three months prior to the maturity date) at a redemption price equal to their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

 The preceding is a summary of the terms of the Indenture and the Notes, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Base Indenture attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, the First Supplemental Indenture attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2, and the form of the Notes attached hereto as Exhibit 4.3, each of which is incorporated herein by reference as though they were fully set forth herein.
