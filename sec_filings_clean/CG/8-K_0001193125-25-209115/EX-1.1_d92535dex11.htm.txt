harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are
incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, (ii) or any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the
Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any issuer information filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act or the Pricing Disclosure Package (or any
amendment or supplement thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each
case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any
Underwriter furnished to the Carlyle Parties in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information
described as such in subsection (b) below.

 (b) Indemnification of the Carlyle Parties by the Underwriters. Each Underwriter
agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless each Carlyle Party, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls any Carlyle Party within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Carlyle Parties in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives
expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Pricing Disclosure Package (or any amendment or supplement thereto), it
being understood and agreed upon that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Prospectus furnished on behalf of each Underwriter: the information contained in the ninth, tenth, eleventh and
twelfth paragraphs under the caption Underwriting.

 (c) Notice and Procedures. If any suit, action,
proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) above, such person (the
 Indemnified Person ) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the Indemnifying Person ) in writing; provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not
relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraphs (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided,
further, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraphs (a) or (b) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or
asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified
Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified
Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the
contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified
Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any

 16

proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and
that all such fees and expenses shall be paid or reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors, officers, agents and employees and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated
in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for any Carlyle Party, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of any Carlyle Party shall be designated in writing by the Carlyle Parties.
The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify
each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the
Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more
than 90 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person
shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder
by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject
matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.

(d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or
insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable
by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Carlyle Parties, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the
other, from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause
(i) but also the relative fault of the Carlyle Parties, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Carlyle Parties on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the (i) total net proceeds (before
deducting expenses) received by the Carlyle Parties from the sale of the Securities and (ii) the difference between (x) the aggregate price to the public received by the Underwriters and (y) the aggregate price paid by the
Underwriters to the Carlyle Parties for the Securities, bear to the aggregate price to the public received by the Underwriters. The relative fault of the Carlyle Parties, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Carlyle Parties or by the Underwriters and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

 (e)
Limitation on Liability. The Carlyle Parties and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one
entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims,
damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or
claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with
respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters obligations to contribute pursuant
to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.

 17

 (f) Non-Exclusive Remedies. The remedies
provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.

8. Effectiveness of Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.

9. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by any of the Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the
Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by any of the Carlyle Parties shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States of America shall have occurred;
(iv) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or
any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on
the Closing Date on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.

 10.
Defaulting Underwriter.

 (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it
has agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms
contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be
entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or
agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any
changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Carlyle Parties or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term Underwriter includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires,
any person not listed in Schedule I hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.

(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters or other persons as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to
purchase the aggregate principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder on such date plus such Underwriter s pro rata share (based on the aggregate principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to
purchase on such date) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.

(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters or other persons as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date exceeds
one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall
terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Carlyle Parties,
except that the Carlyle Parties will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.

 18

 (d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may
have to the Carlyle Parties or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.

11. Payment of Expenses.

(a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Carlyle Parties will
pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of their obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and
any stamp, issue, transfer or similar taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus, any Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the fees and expenses of the Carlyle Parties counsel and independent
accountants; (iv) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification of the Securities under the state or foreign securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may reasonably designate
and the preparation, printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters); (v) the cost of preparing certificates, if any, representing the Securities; (vi) the costs and
charges of the Trustee, any transfer agent and any registrar; (vii) all expenses and application fees incurred in connection with any filing with, and clearance of the offering by, FINRA; (viii) any fees charged by ratings agencies for the
rating of the Securities; (ix) all expenses incurred by the Carlyle Parties in connection with any road show presentation to potential investors; and (x) all expenses and application fees related to the listing of the
Securities on the Exchange.

 (b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company for any reason
fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities because of any failure or refusal on the part of any Carlyle Party to comply with the terms of or to fulfill any of the
conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason any Carlyle Party shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Carlyle Parties agree to reimburse the Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to
themselves severally and are not in default hereunder for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by
the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.

 12. Persons Entitled to Benefit of
Agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be
deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.

 13. Survival. The respective indemnities, rights of contribution,
representations, warranties and agreements of the Carlyle Parties and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Carlyle Parties or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Carlyle Parties or the Underwriters.

14. Certain Defined Terms. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) except where otherwise expressly provided, the term
 affiliate has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act; and (b) the term business day means any day other than a day on which banks are permitted or required to be closed in New York City.

 (ii) In the event that any
Underwriter that is a Covered Entity or a BHC Act Affiliate of such Underwriter becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under this Agreement that may be exercised against such Underwriter are permitted

 Note: Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act, trades in
the secondary market are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing, and the succeeding business day, will be
required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially settle in T+3, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes during such
period should consult their advisors.
