Carlyle Reports Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results
Washington, D.C. and New York, October 31, 2025 The Carlyle Group Inc. (NASDAQ CG) today reported its
unaudited results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025. The full detailed presentation of Carlyle s third
quarter 2025 results can be viewed at ir.carlyle.com.
U.S. GAAP results for Q3 2025 included income before provision for income taxes of $86 million and a margin on
income before provision for income taxes of 25.8%.
Carlyle Chief Executive Officer Harvey M. Schwartz said, Our strong third quarter results demonstrate continued
execution of our strategic growth plan. We generated $17 billion of organic quarterly inflows, continued to scale
strategic areas like Carlyle AlpInvest and Insurance Solutions, and raised significant capital across our Global
Wealth platform. The combination of these growth engines gives us strong momentum through year end and into
2026, and positions Carlyle exceptionally well to exceed our updated 2025 financial targets.
