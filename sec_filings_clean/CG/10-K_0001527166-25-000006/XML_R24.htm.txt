Segment Reporting [Abstract]

Segment Reporting
15. Segment ReportingCarlyle conducts its operations through three reportable segments:
Global Private Equity The Global Private Equity segment advises the Company s buyout, middle market, and
growth capital funds, its U.S. and internationally focused real estate funds, and its infrastructure and natural resources
funds. The segment also includes the NGP Carry Funds advised by NGP.
Global Credit The Global Credit segment advises funds and vehicles that pursue investment strategies including
insurance solutions, liquid credit, opportunistic credit, direct lending, asset-backed finance, aviation finance,
infrastructure credit, cross-platform credit products, and global capital markets.
Global Investment Solutions The Global Investment Solutions segment advises global private equity programs and
related co-investment and secondary activities.
The Company s reportable business segments are differentiated by their various investment focuses and strategies.
Overhead costs are generally allocated based on cash-based compensation and benefits expense for each segment. The
Company s earnings from its investment in NGP are presented in the respective operating captions within the Global Private
Equity segment.
Distributable Earnings. Distributable Earnings, or DE, is a key performance benchmark used in the Company s
industry and is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM ), which is our Chief Executive Officer, in
making resource deployment and compensation decisions and in assessing performance of the Company s three reportable
segments. The CODM also uses DE in budgeting, forecasting, and the overall management of the Company s segments. The
CODM believes that reporting DE is helpful to understanding the Company s business and that investors should review the
same supplemental financial measure that the CODM uses to analyze the Company s segment performance. DE is intended to
show the amount of net realized earnings without the effects of the consolidation of the Consolidated Funds. DE is derived from
the Company s segment reported results and is used to assess performance.
 Distributable Earnings differs from income (loss) before provision for income taxes computed in accordance with U.S.
GAAP in that it includes certain tax expenses associated with certain foreign performance revenues (comprised performance
allocations and incentive fees), and does not include unrealized performance allocations and related compensation expense,
unrealized principal investment income, equity-based compensation expense, net income (loss) attributable to non-Carlyle
interests in consolidated entities, or charges (credits) related to Carlyle corporate actions and non-recurring items that affect
period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of the Company s operational performance. Charges (credits) related to
Carlyle corporate actions and non-recurring items include: charges associated with the Conversion, charges (credits) associated
with acquisitions, dispositions or strategic investments, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, amortization and any
impairment charges associated with acquired intangible assets, transaction costs associated with acquisitions and dispositions,
charges associated with earn-outs and contingent consideration including gains and losses associated with the estimated fair
value of contingent considerations issued in conjunction with acquisitions or strategic investments, impairment charges
associated with lease right-of-use assets, gains and losses from the retirement of debt, charges associated with contract
terminations and employee severance, certain general, administrative and other expenses when the timing of any future
payment is uncertain, and non-recurring items that affect period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of the
Company s operating performance. Management believes the inclusion or exclusion of these items provides investors with a
meaningful indication of the Company s core operating performance.
Fee Related Earnings. Fee Related Earnings, or FRE, is a component of DE and is used to assess the ability of the
business to cover base compensation and operating expenses from total fee revenues. FRE adjusts DE to exclude net realized
performance revenues, realized principal investment income, and net interest (interest income less interest expense). Fee
Related Earnings includes fee related performance revenues and related compensation expense, which is generally 45% of fee
related performance revenues. Fee related performance revenues represent the realized portion of performance revenues that are
measured and received on a recurring basis, are not dependent on realization events, and which have no risk of giveback.
Asset information by segment is not disclosed because this information is not used by the CODM to make resource
deployment decisions or evaluate the performance of the Company s segments.
