Equity-Based Compensation

12 Months Ended

Dec. 31, 2024

Share-Based Payment Arrangement [Abstract]

Equity-Based Compensation
14. Equity-Based CompensationThe Carlyle Group Inc. Amended and Restated 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the Equity Incentive Plan, initially
adopted in May 2012 and as most recently amended and restated on May 29, 2024) is a source of equity-based awards
permitting the Company to grant to Carlyle employees, directors and consultants non-qualified options, share appreciation
rights, common shares, restricted stock units and other awards based on the Company s shares of common stock. A total of
58,800,000 shares of common stock are authorized for the grant of awards under the Equity Incentive Plan, of which a total of
30,091,970 shares of the Company s common stock remain available for grant as of December 31, 2024.
The Company recorded equity-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures of $467.9 million, $249.1 million and
$154.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Equity-based compensation expense
generates deferred tax assets, which are realized when the units vest. The Company recorded corresponding deferred tax
benefits the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 of $88.1 million, $41.1 million and $28.7 million, respectively. A
portion of the accumulated deferred tax asset associated with equity-based compensation expense was reclassified as a current
tax benefit due to units vesting during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The net impact of the addition/
(reduction) in deferred tax assets due to the equity-based compensation expense recorded during the period less the tax
deduction for units that vested was $39.7 million, $12.7 million and $(3.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2024,
2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the total unrecognized equity-based compensation expense related to
unvested deferred restricted stock units was $496.0 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average term
of 1.9 years.
Equity-based awards issued to non-employees, including non-employee directors and consultants, are recognized as
general, administrative and other expenses. The grant-date fair value of deferred restricted stock units granted to non-employees
is charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Equity-based awards that require the satisfaction of future
service criteria are recognized over the relevant service period. The expense for equity-based awards issued to non-employees
was $11.6 million, $6.5 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Restricted Stock Units
The Company grants deferred restricted stock units that are unvested when granted and vest ratably over a service
period, which generally ranges from one year to four years. The grant-date fair value of the deferred restricted stock units
granted to Carlyle s employees is charged to equity-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the required
service period.
During 2021, the Company granted 7.1 million shares long-term, strategic restricted stock units to certain senior
professionals, the majority of which are eligible to vest based on the achievement of annual performance targets over four years
across a number of the Company s employees. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period if it is
probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. The final tranche of these strategic awards vested in February 2025.
During 2023, the Company granted 6.8 million shares related to equity inducement awards granted in connection with
the appointment of the Company s Chief Executive Officer, which included 2.1 million time-based restricted stock units which
are eligible to vest ratably in four equal installments. The first and second installments of the time-based award vested in
December 2023 and 2024, respectively.
Performance-Vesting Restricted Stock Units
The Company has also granted awards which are subject to both a service-based vesting condition and a market price
based vesting condition for certain awards. Compensation cost for the awards containing market conditions, including stock
price performance conditions, is based on a grant-date fair value that factors in the probability that the market conditions will be
achieved and is recognized over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis.
The equity inducement awards granted in connection with the appointment of the Company s Chief Executive Officer
in 2023 included 4.7 million performance-based restricted stock units which contain stock price performance conditions.
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $30.0 million and $49.5 million, respectively,
in equity-based compensation expense related to these performance-based restricted stock units.
During 2024, the Company granted 13.2 million restricted stock units to certain senior Carlyle professionals that are
eligible to vest in three tranches based on the achievement of stock price performance over service periods of one, two, or three
years. Equity-based compensation expense for each tranche is recognized on a straight-line basis over its respective service
period. These awards had a grant date fair value of approximately $347 million, which was derived using the Monte Carlo
Simulation model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the grant date fair value of these awards included a risk-free
rate of 4.15% and a concluded equity volatility of 40%. The Company recognized $201.6 million in equity-based compensation
expense related to these awards during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Common Shares
In connection with its strategic investment in NGP, the Company agreed to grant common shares on an annual basis
with a value not to exceed $10.0 million based on a prescribed formula, which will vest over a 42-month period. Because the
Company accounts for its investment in NGP under the equity method of accounting, the fair value of the shares is recognized
as a reduction to principal investment income. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company
recognized $8.9 million, $8.8 million and $8.4 million, respectively, as a reduction to principal investment income related to
these shares.
A summary of the status of the Company s non-vested equity-based awards as of December 31, 2024 and a summary
