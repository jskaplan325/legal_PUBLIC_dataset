Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, and Governance [Line Items]

Cybersecurity Risk Management Processes for Assessing, Identifying, and Managing Threats [Text Block]
We regularly assess risks from cybersecurity threats, monitor our information systems for potential vulnerabilities, and test those systems pursuant to our cybersecurity policies, standards, processes, and practices, which are integrated into our
overall risk management system. To protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, we use various security tools
that help us identify, protect against, detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents. These efforts are implemented by
our Global Technology & Solutions ( GTS ) team in partnership with our business, legal, and compliance teams, and are
essential for us to conduct investment activities, manage internal administration activities, and connect our global enterprise.
Our systems, data, network, and infrastructure are monitored and administered by formal controls and risk management
processes that log events and help protect the firm s data. In addition, our business continuity plans are designed to allow
critical business functions to continue in an orderly manner in the event of an emergency. The GTS team works closely with our
business segment teams to maintain operational resilience through business continuity planning and annual information
technology disaster recovery and incident response plan testing, which collectively support the goal of mitigating risk were an
emergency to occur. These efforts are underpinned by the implementation of security best practices, where possible, such as:
 Multi-factor authentication for remote access, privileged access management for system administrators,
application whitelisting, laptop encryption, mobile device management software, and advanced malware
defenses on endpoints;
 Incident preparedness and response planning and risk mitigation;
 Independent and continuous security testing, assessment, and third-party risk and vulnerability management;
 Regular security awareness training, including phishing simulations, for Carlyle authorized users;
 Restrictions on access to personal email accounts, cloud storage, social media, risk-based categories of
websites, and USB storage devices;
 Device and system access management policies and procedures that restrict access upon employee or
contractor separation from the company; and
 Compliance attestations by Carlyle personnel on firm policies, such as our acceptable use policy, upon hire
and annually.
In addition, we partner with third parties to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity program, including audits and
assessments performed under the direction of Carlyle s Internal Audit team, which co-sources with third-party cybersecurity
experts in conducting its reviews. GTS also administers the firm s cyber third-party risk management program, which assesses
external service providers before onboarding and provides ongoing monitoring in accordance with certain risk-based
cybersecurity criteria.
To our knowledge, cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous detected or undetected cybersecurity
incidents, have not materially affected us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition; however,
we may learn new facts about these detected or undetected incidents and these facts may lead us to change this materiality
assessment. The sophistication of cyber threats continues to increase and there can be no assurance that the various procedures
and controls we utilize to mitigate these threats will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to our systems. Consequently, given
that the magnitude of cybersecurity incidents or threats are difficult to predict, we are unable to determine at this time whether
risks from cybersecurity threats are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of
operations, or financial condition. For an additional description of cybersecurity risk and potential related impacts on us, see
Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Company Operational risks (including those associated with our
business model), system security risks, breaches of data protection, cyberattacks, or actions or failure to act by our employees
or others with authorized access to our networks, including our ability to insure against such risks, may disrupt our businesses,
result in losses, or limit our growth.
