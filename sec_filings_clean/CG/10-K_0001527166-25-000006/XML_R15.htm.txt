Senior Credit Facility
As of December 31, 2024, the senior credit facility included $1.0 billion in a revolving credit facility. The Company s
borrowing capacity is subject to the ability of the financial institutions in the banking syndicate to fulfill their respective
obligations under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature on April 29, 2027, and
principal amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility accrue interest, at the option of the borrowers, either (a) at an
alternate base rate plus an applicable margin not to exceed 0.50% per annum, or (b) at SOFR (or similar benchmark rate for
non-U.S. dollar borrowings) plus a 0.10% adjustment and an applicable margin not to exceed 1.50% per annum (at
December 31, 2024, the interest rate was 5.43%). There was no amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of
December 31, 2024. The Company made no borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the years ended
December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Global Credit Revolving Credit Facility
Certain subsidiaries of the Company are parties to a revolving line of credit, primarily intended to support certain
lending activities within the Global Credit segment. As currently amended, the Global Credit Revolving Credit Facility
provides for a revolving line of credit with a capacity of $300 million, which matures in September 2027, and a second
revolving line of credit with a capacity of $200 million, which matures in August 2025. The Company s borrowing capacity is
subject to the ability of the financial institutions in the banking syndicate to fulfill their respective obligations under the Global
Credit Revolving Credit Facility. Principal amounts outstanding accrue interest at applicable SOFR or Eurocurrency rates plus
an applicable margin of 2.00% or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 1.00%.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, under the Global Credit Revolving Credit Facility the Company made
borrowings of $5.0 million and 5.0 million, which were subsequently repaid, and there was no balance outstanding as of
December 31, 2024. As of and for both the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no balance outstanding and the
Company made no borrowings under the Global Credit Revolving Credit Facility.

(1)Maturity date is earlier of date indicated or the date that the CLO is dissolved.
(2)Incurs interest at EURIBOR plus applicable margins as defined in the agreement.
(3)This term loan was fully repaid during the year ended December 31, 2024.
(4)Incurs interest at SOFR plus 1.76%.
(5)Incurs interest at the average effective interest rate of each class of purchased securities plus 0.50% spread percentage.
The CLO term loans are secured by the Company s investments in the respective CLO, have a general unsecured
interest in the Carlyle entity that manages the CLO, and generally do not have recourse to any other Carlyle entity. Interest
expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $24.4 million, $24.9 million, and $10.7 million,
respectively. The fair value of the outstanding balance of the CLO term loans at December 31, 2024 and 2023 approximated par
value based on current market rates for similar debt instruments. These CLO term loans are classified as Level III within the
fair value hierarchy.
European CLO Financing - February 28, 2017
A subsidiary of the Company is a party to a financing agreement with several financial institutions. As of December
31, 2024, the financing agreement provided the Company with a term loan of 22.8 million ($23.5 million at December 31,

2024). This term loan is secured by the Company s investments in the retained notes in certain European CLOs that were
formed in 2014 and 2015. This term loan will mature on the earlier of September 21, 2029 or the date that the certain European
CLO retained notes have been redeemed. The Company may prepay the term loan in whole or in part at any time. Interest on
this term loan accrues at EURIBOR plus applicable margins (6.13% at December 31, 2024).
Master Credit Agreement - Term Loans
The Company assumed liabilities under master credit agreements previously entered into by CBAM under which a
financial institution provided term loans to CBAM for the purchase of eligible interests in CLOs. Term loans issued under these
master credit agreements are secured by the Company s investment in the respective CLO as well as any senior management
fee and subordinated management fee payable by each CLO. Term loans generally bear interest at SOFR plus a weighted
average spread over SOFR on the CLO notes, which is due quarterly. As of December 31, 2024, term loans under these
agreements had $25.5 million outstanding. The master credit agreement matures in January 2031.
CLO Repurchase Agreements
On February 5, 2019, the Company entered into a master credit facility agreement (the Carlyle CLO Financing
Facility ) to finance a portion of the risk retention investments in certain European CLOs managed by the Company. Each
transaction entered into under the Carlyle CLO Financing Facility will bear interest at a rate based on the weighted average
effective interest rate of each class of securities that have been sold plus a spread to be agreed upon by the parties. As of
December 31, 2024, 171.1 million ($177.1 million) was outstanding under the Carlyle CLO Financing Facility. Additional
borrowings may be made on terms agreed upon by the Company and the counterparty subject to the terms and conditions of the
Carlyle CLO Financing Facility.
Each transaction entered into under the CLO Financing Facility provides for payment netting and, in the case of a
default or similar event with respect to the counterparty to the CLO Financing Facility, provides for netting across transactions.
Generally, upon a counterparty default, the Company can terminate all transactions under the CLO Financing Facility and offset
amounts it owes in respect of any one transaction against collateral, if any, or other amounts it has received in respect of any
other transactions under the CLO Financing Facility; provided, however, that in the case of certain defaults, the Company may
only be able to terminate and offset solely with respect to the transaction affected by the default. During the term of a
transaction entered into under the CLO Financing Facility, the Company will deliver cash or additional securities acceptable to
the counterparty if the securities sold are in default. Upon termination of a transaction, the Company will repurchase the
previously sold securities from the counterparty at a previously determined repurchase price. The CLO Financing Facility may
be terminated at any time upon certain defaults or circumstances agreed upon by the parties.
The repurchase agreements may result in credit exposure in the event the counterparty to the transaction is unable to
fulfill its contractual obligations. The Company minimizes the credit risk associated with these activities by monitoring
counterparty credit exposure and collateral values. Other than margin requirements, the Company is not subject to additional
terms or contingencies which would expose the Company to additional obligations based upon the performance of the securities
pledged as collateral.
The Company assumed liabilities under a master credit facility agreement previously entered into by CBAM (the
 CBAM CLO Financing Facility, together with the Carlyle CLO Financing Facility, the CLO Financing Facilities ) to
finance a portion of the risk retention investments in certain European CLOs managed by CBAM (see Note 3, Acquisitions, to
the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023). The maximum facility amount is 100.0 million, but may be expanded on such terms agreed upon by the Company and
the counterparty subject to the terms and conditions of the CBAM CLO Financing Facility. Each transaction entered into under
the CBAM CLO Financing Facility will bear interest at a rate based on the weighted average effective interest rate of each class
of securities that have been sold plus a spread to be agreed upon by the parties. As of December 31, 2024, 61.2 million
($63.3 million) was outstanding under the CBAM CLO Financing Facility.

previously issued.
(4)Issued in September 2018 at 99.914% of par.
The issuers may redeem the senior notes, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a price equal to the
greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining
scheduled payments of principal and interest on any notes being redeemed discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual
basis at the Treasury Rate plus 40 basis points (30 basis points in the case of the 3.500% senior notes), plus in each case accrued
and unpaid interest on the principal amounts being redeemed.
Subordinated Notes
In May 2021, an indirect subsidiary of the Company issued $435.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625%
Subordinated Notes due May 15, 2061 (the Subordinated Notes ), on which interest is payable quarterly accruing from May
11, 2021. In June 2021, an additional $65.0 million aggregate principal amount of these Subordinated Notes were issued and
are treated as a single series with the already outstanding $435.0 million aggregate principal amount. The Subordinated Notes
are unsecured and subordinated obligations of the issuer, and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the Guarantees ),
jointly and severally, on a subordinated basis, by the Company, each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships, and CG Subsidiary
Holdings L.L.C., an indirect subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the Guarantors ). The Consolidated Funds are not
guarantors, and as such, the assets of the Consolidated Funds are not available to service the Subordinated Notes under the
Guarantee. The Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at the issuer s option in whole at any time or in part from time to time on
or after June 15, 2026 at a redemption price equal to their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the date of redemption. If interest due on the Subordinated Notes is deemed no longer to be deductible in the U.S., a
 Tax Redemption Event, the Subordinated Notes may be redeemed, in whole, but not in part, within 120 days of the
occurrence of such event at a redemption price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, the Subordinated Notes may be redeemed, in whole, but not in part, at any time
prior to May 15, 2026, within 90 days of the rating agencies determining that the Subordinated Notes should no longer receive
partial equity treatment pursuant to the rating agency s criteria, a rating agency event, at a redemption price equal to 102% of
their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption.
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Subordinated Notes was $356.4 million and
$411.8 million, respectively. Fair value is based on active market quotes and the notes are classified as Level I within the fair
value hierarchy. For each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred $23.5 million of
interest expense on the Subordinated Notes.
Debt Covenants
The Company is subject to various financial covenants under its loan agreements including, among other items,
maintenance of a minimum amount of management fee-earning assets. The Company is also subject to various non-financial

covenants under its loan agreements and the indentures governing its senior notes. The Company was in compliance with all
financial and non-financial covenants under its various loan agreements as of December 31, 2024.
Loans Payable of Consolidated FundsLoans payable of Consolidated Funds primarily represent amounts due to holders of debt securities issued by the
CLOs. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the following borrowings were outstanding (Dollars in millions):

(1)Fair Value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 reflects the amortized cost of outstanding revolving credit balances which
approximates fair value.
(2)The subordinated notes do not have contractual interest rates, but instead receive distributions from the excess cash flows of the
CLOs.
Loans payable of the CLOs are collateralized by the assets held by the CLOs and the assets of one CLO may not be
used to satisfy the liabilities of another. This collateral consisted of cash and cash equivalents, corporate loans, corporate bonds
and other securities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the CLO assets was $7.9 billion and $6.8 billion,
respectively.
